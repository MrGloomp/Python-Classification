"We stayed for 4 nights in a 2 bedroom suite. The bedrooms and lounge area were a good size, comfortable and well equiped. Breakfast was fine. There is a Target supermarket less than 5 minutes drive away. Although the hotel is some distance from the centre of Chicago, it is very easy to get there by train. The station is... More",pos
"Sheets had ink stains, shower was difficult to operate, towels were threadbare, fight in lobby woke us up, breakfast was stale, beds are tiny.",neg
"The location is very convenient. The hotel was within walking distance to almost everything. With it being on the opposite side of Canal than Bourdon, there was no noise from people outside. The rooms were nice. Very comfy bed. The room had a microwave and mini frig, which was a nice surprise. Also, when we arrived at the hotel we noticed that the parking garage is right next to it. The website had said that parking was valet only and was 34, however the garage offered self parking for 25 per 24 hour period with add on hours if needed. The only thing is you don't have in and out privledges like with valet. If you plan on walking anyway or need to save a few bucks, that'd be the way to go. I would definitely recommend this hotel. The only reason for the 3 rating on the staff was due to the valets and bell boys congregating in the door way hollering with their friends. It was loud and unprofessional. The front desk staff and everyone else we encountered were great.",pos
"The room was clean, no issues at all. Pool very warm",pos
"This was the second WORST hotel experience ever. Nothing positive to say in any way. Dirty, shabby condition of room, piles of trash with flies left for days in hallway, noise from semi truck parked on road, quality breakfast dismal, surly staff. You name it, it was awful.",neg
"Basic, older accommodations. Liked the two sinks, one being outside bathroom. Neither sink drained water well. Beds were comfortable. Wifi didn't reach to the rooms, but was available free in the lounge area. The complementary breakfast buffet was adequate.",avg
We thought it was clean and the staff was nice. Great hotel breakfast with lots of choices. Bummed we didn't get to use the pool/hot tub.,pos
The service staff at the Homewood suites have exceeded my expectations during my stay. Fresh gourmet coffee was prepared and offered as soon as I entered the front lobby. Check in was swift and easy as well the knowledge of the staff by given recommendations for food and entertainment for the evening.,pos
"Just an overnight stop to a destination, but so welcoming and convenient to shopping, restaurants and gas station. Greeted by an exceptionally nice front desk person. Continental breakfast the next morning was easy and quick with standard selection of waffles, biscuits and gravy, sausage, egg patties, cereals, juice, yogurt, fresh fruit. Hotel was clean, comfortable and safe. Nice stay.",pos
don't stay here!,pos
We really enjoyed the staff and cleanliness.,pos
Comfortable hotel near waterfront. I was working on a yacht nearby for a few dyas and this made a good base at the end of the day.,pos
"It was a good room, especially for 1 person. And for it being a double tree hotel, it was amazingly affordable.",pos
"The Hotel Garibaldi is family run by a sister and brother, who inherited it from their parents, so it has been in the family for over 40 years. It is an extremely clean, and well maintained hotel, with a very nice breakfast served in a colorful breakfast room. The staff are very friendly, and accomadating, and do their best to make your stay a very pleasant one. The hotel is in an excellent location for visits to Venice, as the bus stop to Venice is right across the street, and you may buy your combination bus tickets, and vaporetta tickets right at the hotel desk. The hotel is on a tree lined street, on the block before the pedestrain square of historical Mestre begins, thus giving you a easy walk to restaurants, and shopping. Hotel Garibaldi is very reasonably priced compared to the excessive rate in Venice, and with the bus only 15 minutes away from Venice, makes it very convenient, and easier than lugging your luggage to hotels in Venice. This was our 8th stay at the hotel, and we have had many enjoyable return trips",pos
"The rooms were big, staff was GREAT, rooms were clean and the pool and jacuzzi were clean. However, not very close to the beach or really anything. It's not a horrible walk but I am used to staying at the aspinquid and that is much closer to everything than the sea view. Although, overall I liked the Sea View better... More",pos

We stay there only one night (for shopping at woodburry outlet). It is very clean & quiet and breakfast is included. Worth the money.,pos

"This overall excellent motel has the additional virtue of being within easy walking distance (about 5 minutes on a path along the Virgin river) to the visitor center at Zion. The rooms are comfortable and well appointed, and the included breakfast is very good. The grounds are attractively landscaped and beautifully maintained The staff is friendly and very accomodating.

"Hotel was very nice and clean. Breakfast was good could of had a little more variety thou. Mainly fruit and cereals. Only had scrambled eggs, sausage links, and pre made small pancakes not even fresh ones was only choice for hot food. Had bagels and bread to toast also. Located next to Dave and Busters and when it closed there was lots of yelling and reving of car engines and carrying on for atleast 30 minutes or more when we was trying to sleep. Not sure if it was an isolated happening or its every night that way. Then there was a generator that ran all night long in the next parking lot which kept us from being able to sleep well Saturday night. Hotel and staff was all very nice but the surrounding noise made it a very long night with very little sleep due to all the noise outside our hotel window. Will look for another location next time forsure.",pos
"Great location. The staff, food and overall service impecable.",pos
This is a nice little RV Park. There are 5 RV spaces beside the Motel. All sites are full hook ups. No RV showers or laundry facilities. TV reception with antenna is weak. Wifi is good using the parks but you can also hookup to the museum wifi across the street. Very close walk to the Grocery Store and restaurants.... More,pos

My stay at Days Inn Bowling Green was nice. It was close to Bowling Green State University which we were visiting. Location was perfect. Very close to food and shopping. Coffee maker in room and free breakfast in the morning. Price was great. I would stay there again.,pos

"Unique shaped room was comfortable and efficient. Furnishings are dated but still retain their opulence. Room was very quiet considering there was a parade and several trains passing overnight. Pool was refreshing on hot July afternoon but clearly needed some updating. Rusty lounge chairs, flaking paint, dirty skylights and windows seemed to be normal for this area. We chose a... More",pos
Really over priced!! Bed extremely hard! Was not told about contruction when i made reservations! Breakfast was not bad!,avg
"The hotel itself was very nice. Staff was very helpful, especially with accommodating us when we asked to check in early. The problem was with cleanliness. Our room was not clean enough - I found a floss stick on the table in our room. What looked like a condom was found when we went to use the spa. And the pool was full of leaves and dirt on the bottom. Otherwise, our room would have been great. Very large with everything you need for a comfortable stay. Nice large screen tv as well - made my husband happy.",pos
"We have normally stayed at the lodge in Zion for the past several years. This year it was all booked up for a last minute reservation. I did some research knowing our family wanted clean rooms, be close to the entrance, close to the river, have scenic views, continental breakfast and near other services. We were pleasantly surprised after arriving... More",pos
Room was spotless. Staff so professional. Right on the beach. Boardwalk right at the back of hotel. Ocean view. Balcony. Starbucks next door. Great breakfast. Coffee. Bar downstairs. Quiet.,pos
The reason for the mediocre cleanliness rating was the carpet. It was fairly new but seemed damp and had a gummy feel to it. Glad that I brought flip flops to use in the room. All of the property staff that I encountered were super friendly and helpful. They made you feel like they appreciated you being a guest at their facility.,pos
Very convenient for Mt Rose and Diamond Peak - best value skiing in Tahoe,avg

Hotel was comfortable and close to both trains and metro. Safe area. Staff were really good particularly the young woman who helped us catch the TGV even though we were resigned to missing it. Walking distance to Arc DTriomphe and Champs Elysees. And a freaky elevator.,pos
"Our room wasn't ready. We showed up at 3:30 waited till 4:00 to get into our room. Check in is at 3:00. There was never any complimentary cookies, the dish was always empty. No hot water for cocoa. The pool was dirty. Our room was clean comforable. However, disappointed with our stay. Won't stay at this hotel again.",neg
"We had a great experience and nights sleep at the hotel. We were there for one night college touring with my daughter. The hotel was clean, beautiful view, had a nice restaurant and bar with beautiful views of the harbor and bay. Room was clean and beds were super comfortable. Not much around this hotel for things to do besides a beautiful walking/running/biking trail infront of the hotel. Very short drive to get to downtown San Diego which has much to offer.",pos
There were drug dealers out side of this hotel and roaches in our room I would not recommend this hotel my wife had to use one of the cleaning lady's vacuums because it was so filthy it was not at all a good stay,neg
"We were staying at the hotel for our 10 year college reunion and the location was perfect, the service was excellent and I loved the continental breakfast. Best location and gorgeous hotel.",pos
"Great location within walking distance of Hyannis. We had a wonderful room (92), very comfortable bed and a balcony overlooking the water where two swans hung-out. Breakfast at onsite was good and reasonably priced, coffee not so good. The front office staff are very friendly and helpful. We stayed for two days last year so this was a repeat visit.... More",pos
Clean and comfortable. Really nice staff.,pos
Phone and internet signal extremely weak. Room has refrigerator and microwave. Very close to grocery and shopping. Much more reasonable cost than most other hotels at the time.,avg
"Hotel is old. This might be section due to be torn down, which would be proper. It was just a roof over our heads. Not nearly worth what we paid, even tho' personnel were good helpful. Anyone else should wait til this property is rebuilt before staying there.",neg
Great A/C and restrooms!,pos
This place is ah-MAZ-ing!,pos
"Es un hotel lleno de paradojas, el lugar es lindo, el club de playa un oasis, la alberca es de las mejores, el servicio es claro que se esfuerzan por estar ms all de las espectativas (en la alberca lo logran), las habitaciones espaciosas y con una vista hermosa. Amenidades de Ferragamo, chocolates Lindt en la noche, vajilla Noritake en todos sus servicios, sugerencias de Met por todos lados, huspedes verdaderamente finos (no hay Mirreyes), triple filtro de seguridad para ingresar....pero: el edificio se siente falto de verdaderos detalles de calidad (los shampoos y cremitas no cuentan), la cocina no esta a la altura y lo ms desafortunado: esta junto a Revolcadero, una de las playas ms populares de Acapulco, de esas en donde la msica de banda, la seora en brassiere y los nios en paales son el un must si te quieres sentir incluido. El personal de seguridad hace muy buen trabajo manteniendo la playa libre y controlando el acceso a la alberca, todo con mucha amabilidad y cero prepotencia. Es un buen ejemplo de que no se puede tener todo en la vida.",pos
"This is a high quality hotel, comfortable, clean with great rooms and sometimes surprising details (leopard skin bath robes!) that make it worth coming back to. Add to that the location in cute old Alexandria and the fact that DC proper is within easy reach as are some great walks down the river and you've got a winner.",pos
"Best Gatlinburg Cabins I cannot say enough positive things about Elk Springs Resort! The location is super convenient, the cabin amenities are first-class, the cleanliness is perfection and the views are amazing. I have stayed in other cabins in Gatlinburg and theirs are by far the best. Whether you are planning a romantic weekend for two or a 10-person trip, they most definitely have a cabin that will meet and exceed your needs. Almost Heaven might be my favorite thus far! I just went last weekend and I cannot wait to plan my next trip...I will absolutely be staying at Elk Springs Resort! Seriously, best Gatlinburg Cabins!!!",pos

It was nice and clean I just wish they had more trash cans lol,pos
"This is a nice, basic motel, near the center of town, with friendly staff and clean, comfortable rooms. It is not fancy, but was a great value for the money.

"I was pleased with the hotel overall, but have two complaints/warnings, one of which is rather serious. The day after I checked out and was looking through my suitcase while at my next destination, it hit me that I had left some clothing in the wardrobe of the hotel! These were not just old T-shirts, either, but one casual dress,... More",avg
I had a fantastic receptionist. When I walked in just was smiley and so nice. I accidentally booked the room for the 23rd instead of the 22nd. She went out of her way to make sure they could get me a too. At the price that I had booked it for on the 23rd. I was a very nice room for the price of it. I will go back again.,pos
I found the Howard Johnson to be located in a conveniant location & I received the best value for my dollar.,pos

"Couldn't be happier. Rented 2 rooms for my sister and son--who were very happy with the hotel facilities, the rooms and staff. Rooms were clean, no surprises.",pos
"Was there for a get together at a friends home. Actually was only in the room to sleep and shower. However, everytime I entered the lobby, the Front Desk Person greeted me with a Smile and Hello. They are going under renovations right now, but it was still very comfortable.",pos
"Amazing stay! Check in was a breeze... Very close to my destination. The front desk agent was very helpful. A lot of good restaurants in proximity. This will be my new place to stay, as I request Raleigh, NC!",pos
"Although, the location of this hotel is close to UofO (about 5-10 minutes), the loudness of people passing by throughout the night (probably coming from downtown) and hotel guests made it hard to relax and a bit scary and unsafe for my daughter and I visiting the university for the day. Front desk service was really good from the ladies, but a bit rude from an older gentleman who seemed to be annoyed we showed up to check in a before their set check-in time of 3 pm. The hot tub is located in an isolated place at one corner of the hotel right next to an RV that serves as the home to someone. Very isolated and not inviting at all. The room was clean, but cover sheets were a bit smelly.",avg
Glad I only stayed for a few hours. I didn't feel safe at all traveling as a woman alone.,neg
"At check in, the front desk person was unfriendly, even rude to those waiting to check in or check out. In the room, used plastic bottles filled with water were left in the refrigerator freezer, the lights beside the bed were burned out and the drain in the bathroom sink did not have a pop-up drain plug to allow water to be filled in the sink.",neg
"The manager was on his personal cell phone for about 15 minutes before he noticed we were there. ... he was very rude with a new trainee, and very rude to us..... and other customers. .. For that reason I will not recommend this hotel to friends and family. ..",neg
It's a nice hotel with comfort and spacious rooms. Has a good location. Rooms are quiet and have all necessary facilities. It is definitely worth the money. The only drawback is the free WiFi which is very slow.,pos
awesome location and price to the Cary Booth Amphitherater,pos
"It was a very nice hotel, looked beautiful outside and inside, very clean, very friendly, they had morning coffee in the lobby and in the afternoon wine and tea. The location was awesome, since there is lot's to do in Old Town Alexandria plus it is close to Airport and Washington DC. I will truly recommend it!!! Oh by the way they also had 24 hour Room Service :o)",pos
The service here was wonderful!! The workers went out of their way to make sure any problems were dealt with in a quick and timely manner. I loved the service and plan to stay here anytime we visit Alamosa.,pos
"The hotel is clean, comfortable and quiet. The staff is very friendly and helpful and the parking is easy. A perfect place to stay when I visit Blacksburg! This is my second stay in this hotel, and I anticipate there being many more.",pos
We had kids with us from the ages of 21 down to 10 years old and there was something for all ages. We all had a great time.,pos
"When I arrived, there was no parking. I told the girl at the front desk that I had a handicap and she still told me to try to the parking along the river or across the street. She never offered to help with my bags. I ended up leaving my car at the check in isle for about an hour until my daughter arrived and parked it for me. Remote control for the TV did not work. Could connect to the internet but because it was so slow, I could not even download my email!",avg
"Una experiencia penosa, el interior del hotel de los aos 70, viejo, oliendo la moqueta mal, puertas que se caian a trozos. En recepcion me obligaron a pagar a la llegada la estancia de 3 dias, a pesar de tener todos los datos de mi tarjeta de empresa. Para utlizar el garaje, tienes que dejar un deposito de 30 euros en efectivo, no admiten ni siquiera la tarjeta de credito. Los muebles de la habtacion penosos y las zonas comunes del hotel, les hace falta una reforma desde hace 30 aos. Viajo por toda Espaa y hacia tiempo que no pisaba un hotel asi. Nada recomendable.",neg
"Booked travel  pkg through Expedia, never again!. Would have left immediately, but everywhere else  booked for this event  and left us stuck !..Dirty filthy ,roaches all over the place. Now I don't expect much from a cheap hotel and it is CHEAP but it is by far the worst I have ever seen and im not a 5 star hotel ,complaining wimp. But I had to write my very first hotel review!!.All 5 of the rooms we went through/viewed  in 3 nights smelled  BAD, the floors were so dirty and gross I never took my shoes off. The bathrooms were full of mold and filth the tubs look like someone tried to paint them 10 yrs ago and you didn't want to be be barefoot in there believe me.One shower had the on/off valve at the shower  head? Nicotine stained ceilings/walls with holes in them. Terrrible beds with bed bugs!  springs popping out ,comforters with all sort of unknown stains.The last room had the stove removed,leaving the natural gas pipe/valve  exposed with no plug on the line allowing anyone to turn it on.That is a very serious Hazard. The kind that LEVELS buildings killing everyone.When I told the desk she said oh thought they plugged those up..Im pretty sure these are rented as apartments during off peak times cheaper.The kind of damage substained to these rooms doesn't come from travelers with their families, there was grease so thick on the range hood and sides of the stoves you could scrape it off.The doors had all been kicked in and broke the trim making the doors barely able to latch",neg
"Clean, economical and okay bed. There was one unwanted visitor who was drunk and rowdy. The staff asked the person to leave because he was disturbing most of the motel.

I stayed a few days while visiting family in the area. The place was clean and very comfortable. Everyone was friendly and helpfull. I will stay there in the future and recommend it to my friends and family.,pos
Love how I can count on La Quinta for a great nights sleep. Best beds! I wasn't expecting this inn to be as updated as it was. Always appreciate that they are pet friendly. Breakfast wasn't so great....luke warm everything.,pos
"So, I have never written a poor review, and usually think the things people complain about are way better than what is listed on the review. However,I have never been so disgusted by a smoke-smelled room. When calling the front desk about it, their only help was to send cleaning services by. They showed up, and sprayed some spray in the air, and turned to ask us if that was better. Needless to say, it wasn't better. They said they were booked and could not do anything for us. I have never spent so much on a room and been so disappointed with the cleanliness and odor of a room we had to stay in with zero customer service to try to fix it. We purchased a nice room with a balcony to be able to enjoy the beautiful views, and did not go on it at all because of the stench even outside. I would never stay here again.",neg
"I stayed one night in a single room. I had a private patio in a charming garden setting. The room decor was was very 19th century, but the ameneties, for the most part, were up to date 21st century.",pos
Room was nice and clean. We had a king size bed with hardwood floors. Would most definitely stay again when on the area,pos

"This hotel is quite run down, and in need of rehabilitation. In my room, the sink was cracked, the tub was chipped, and the shower controls damaged. The bed mattress was a tad worn as well, and the AC unit didn't seem to heat or cool to the stated temperature. At one point, the room was around 68 and cool, so I heated it up to 72. The unit ran for about 2 minutes before shutting off, ineffectively heating the room. I didn't expect much as this was a last minute rental, and its' proximity to downtown Aiken was nice.",neg

A mouse between the bed cover and blanket (fortunately not between the sheets where I was) woke me up the last night of my stay. I slapped at it and it went beneath the bed.

There was lipstick on one of the coffee cups.,neg
Bathrooms were filthy.  Door did not shut correctly.  No security - car was broken to.,neg
"When I pay for a Hotel room I feel that I should be able to invite any quest that I want to visit my room. This Hotel interferes with this comfort with stares at your friends and by adding additional charges to you account for having visitors. I do have an appreciation for security, however, at the cost of the rooms it guesst should be give more relaxed comfort.",neg
Great place to stay while we slept. We stayed here while we visited family over a week. During our stay there were many workmen here from all over helping the surrounding communities recover from the flooding in the fall of 2013.,avg
No hot water and no heat in room. I checked out after one night. The staff refused to give me a receipt when I checked out and continued to charge my credit card. They won't refund. They are cheap but you don't even get what you pay for.,neg

Something should be done at this hotel. The room had a foul odor when we came in and we had to run the AC for about an hour to get rid of most of it. The pool water looked grimy.

The bed and pillows were terrible. The property was old and didn't feel clean at all. We tried the Hot Tube one evening and it was so hot we couldn't even get in and hardly had any jet action anyway.

"To me, Heaven-On-Earth is a really hot Jacuzzi with strong jets - I was in 7th Heaven! -Staff were friendly, listened to our needs, and promptly responded appropriately. Our extra needs attended to were of our own doing - not for lack of cleanliness, service, or amenities. -Room was as pictured - nice quality, clean. Difference on matress opinions - too soft for one, just right for another in our party. We had a roll-a-way bed that was much better quality than past experiences, although a bit wide for the space--we managed. Price was as quoted ahead of time...no suprises. -Breakfast Room clean, adequate. Food was a nice variety and hot food was good to really good. Biscuits were almost as good as Mom used to make - and we don't say that lightly. -My one confusion was that - admittedly I did not read the info about the added fees-I thought it was for the typical incidentals hotels at least used to charge, but I got nothing back...oops.

"Nippersink is very beautiful place to have your ceremony and reception. From the outside when you first walk in, the place looks a little out dated but once you get inside it is beautiful. The hotel is a bit run down as well, but for the price per night, you really can't go wrong. I think for the ceremony, the bushes could use a trimming they were very tall and couldn't see the children in our bridal party until they were down the slope, but it wasn't a big problem.

"Hotel was clean and room size was fine. Mini fridge and microwave in room were a plus. Pool area was nice with good sized pool and fitness equipment. Restaurant food was good (we got a $14 credit to use for breakfast between the three of us so it still cost $20) but service was very slow. The first floor, which we walked through to get to the elevator, reeked of cigarette smoke. This can be avoided by parking out back or using the stairs. My biggest complaint was the WIFI. I paid for a hotel rather than camping because I needed WIFI to get some work done. While I could get my phone to connect, my computer would not recognize the free signal. After 20 minutes on hold with the tech support group, the answer that I got was to sit next to the door. This worked to connect but the signal dropped again once I moved back into the room. The promise that they would reset the signal did not seem to be kept as this was an issue both nights I was there. Overall this was a decent hotel and much better than what others in our group experienced at competitors in the area.",avg

There was a loud buzzing noise that went on all night and prevented me from sleeping well... I called right after I had made reservations to verify that our room would be the room pictured and they assured me it would be, it was not. My son had to sleep in the bed with us because the pull out bed was at the other end of the suite instead of being right next to the bedroom. I was not pleased with our stay.",avg

"The hotel is within walking distance of most of the attractions we were interested in, so driving was minimalized. The room itself was well-appointed and had everything working as advertised. Being downtown, getting to it could be a challenge if you don't know Monterey well, so study your maps carefully. Parking was an extra and was pretty tight. Would not recommend trying to park there with SUVs or particularly large vehicles, especially at night when all the good slots will be taken. Owners were friendly and helpful, and the continental breakfast was very good.",pos

The area is the mushroom capital of the world. The area has a strong sulfur smell. Also there was a party going on behind our room in the hotel. It went on until 12 midnight - which I thought was late - I was tired and wanted to get some sleep. Calling the front desk at 10:30 and 11 and 11:30 did not remedy the situation.

The cleaning lady came by and cleaned it up and gave us a plunger. It continued to stop up/drain slow for the remainder of our two day stay. We did report it to the front desk, but whether anyone actually checked it out, I can't say. Other than being a nuisance, it wasn't a big issue. As for the location, we expected there to be more in South Port and were disappointed with the town overall. Next time we will stay at Carolina Beach or in Wilmington, which both have more things to do.",pos

We only stayed one night on our way to Alabama. The room smelled so bad of smoke that I could taste it. My nose was stuffy all night.

Several people just hanging around outside sitting in lawn chairs by their room doors, other people walking around barefoot all over the hotel. The women at the counter were both very nice and helpful. Some of the building areas were falling apart. The carpeting was filthy and we were given rooms clear in the back maze of the motel because it appeared the residents were occupying any rooms that had direct outside access or balconies. People were literally moving in on the day we arrived. Unless you are desperate for a room avoid this place.",neg

"This was a decent place to stay for a short weekend trip to Pittsburgh. I'd book for a 1-2 night stay but I'd look for a nicer hotel if I planned to stay longer. The staff was friendly and helpful they quickly fixed our sink which was found to be leaking when we checked in. The facility is showing a little wear and could be cleaner, but it wasn't filthy like some other Super 8 locations I've frequented. Our room was sufficiently clean. The biggest draw for us was the price and the location for a short stay. The neighborhood is quiet there are no residential neighborhoods right next to the property. There's an Aldi grocery store across the street if you need snacks or other food items. The basic breakfast was nice for a quick bite before leaving there was yogurt, toast, cinnamon rolls, muffins and even waffles. The only complaint that I have has nothing to do with the motel or staff it was the guests. A bunch of high-school or college age punks were staying there too and created lots of noise and disturbances they behaved like the place was their dorm or frat house. Eventually management got them to quiet down but I think that they should have called the local police and had them forcefully ejected from the premises. Cheap lodging invites punks it's a risk you take if you stay in an inexpensive place like this.",pos

"The Country Inn at Galena is a very nice hotel and met our needs just fine. The rooms are HUGE, the bed was very comfortable, the TV has so many channels, it would be impossible not to find something that suited you. The breakfast was very good, although the seating area is pretty cramped. The hotel staff were very friendly and called to make sure we were settled in a half or so after we arrived. We really only have two comments to consider (for both hotel management and those who might want to stay here). First, we were surprised that our room did not have a refrigerator. It's easily one of the largest hotel rooms we have stayed in, so there's plenty of space. Galena is known for its restaurants, and we, like many guests, had leftovers. Thankfully, the temps were low enough that we were able to store it in the car. For such a nicely equipped and modern place, the lack of a refrigerator was surprising. Second, our A/C-heater unit was noisy. I have gotten so used to those things being noisy that I'm considering writing the Amana company and asking them WHY their hotel units are all universally noisy, even when relatively new. It rattled and there was not amount of pushing, shoving, or kicking that would make it stop. We would definitely stay here again when visiting Galena, though we now know to remember we don't have a place to store leftovers. Overall, it's a wonderful hotel.",pos
"Second time we stayed at this place. Out the front door, the Hotel is located close to the newly refurbish old downtown (out the back, door close to the still old down town). They took our credit card upon checkin so they could charge us an extra 5 to park in their nearly empty parking lot. The tub/shower faucet blew off it's pipe, resulting in a horizontal spray, making the shower totally unsable, grest timing if your trying to get an early start. We had a problem adjusting the temperature up 2 degree. Hardly seems like the same place.",neg

The hotel was fine for the price and the staff was nice. The problem was I had a prepaid reservation/confirmation and the hotel routinely overbooks resulting no room available. Hotels.com refunded my price but I got stuck getting another room in a different hotel for twice the price. Talked to staff and this happens all the time. Hotel is allowing guests to extend stays even if already booked resulting in this problem. Reported to Hotels.com,avg
It was overall ok. The pros: The location was perfect right on the beach next to all the entertainment and restaurants. Free breakfast with a descent selection. . The cons: The only pool this hotel had was indoor! It did have a hot tub both pool and hot tub below average. The pool area only had 5 lounge chairs. Very small. We were torn between this and the Hilton next door which is a notch up due to the Hampton inn having free breakfast and the Hilton having a nicer pool area. We figured that we would save more with the free breakfast and went with the Hampton in. But after being there I would do the Hilton because of pool. It gives you more of a vacation feel. We figured we had the beach so the pool was not a factor. But we went with kids and the beach can be exhausting! Also the elevator and hallways were so hot no AC in those areas.,pos

"We've stayed here before and enjoy the beach area. The first room we got had an awful smell. Very rotten smell. So we called and asked to be moved the lady on the phone said they were sold out and offered to have someone come spray the room. Is that a joke! That's masking the smell not getting rid of it. Finally we moved to a different room. The room smelled fine but the tv didn't work. My fianc called front desk, after about 10 minutes someone picked up and told him to turn to a specific channel (48) and leave it on there for a while then it should work. How does that even make sense I have to idea. But we did it. Of course it didn't work. So he called no one picked up. So we stopped by the front desk on our way to dinner and they said they would send someone to fix it. Hours later we got back to the room and it still wasn't fixed. Because of the lack of customer service and poor rooms we won't stay here again.",neg

Being that it was my birthday trip and I was getting dressed to go out every night, I hated not being able to see myself in a full-length mirror before I went out to hit the town. I was also disappointed that the bar closed at 8 p.m. so if you're looking for a party hotel, this is not the one for you! But you can walk to some others down the strip.",avg

I am from the area so I knew of the hotel but had never stayed there so I was pleasantly surprised to see the quality of service and the really fantastic decor inside each and every detail of the hotel. I knew it was well located to going out and about in Old Town Alexandria but there is also an airport shuttle and people were very helpful in getting more information about transportation to Washington etc. I got a great rate on Hotels.com so that made it more worth it. I would pay the regular prices if I was only going to be there for a few nights but if you can get the rate for better it really stands above the other local options like the Holiday or Comfort Inn. I was very impressed with the high quality.,pos
Perfekt stay for the last night of our vacation before we left home from LAX. Hotel is surrounded by good restaurants and shopping facilities.,pos

Arrived late at night no reception, no security just phoned a call centre to be given entry code. Operator did not even know where apartment was so we spent 30 mins walking around to find it. Answer machine had message on it from environmental health responding to previous complaints.",neg
"I loved the location, gorgeous decor, complimentary coffee and tea in the morning, the pool (although I wish it wasn't shut down for four hours between 10-2), onsite parking with valet and in and out options and nearby restaurants.The check in was a bit rocky because the woman who checked me in took my name, disappeared for 10 minutes to tend to something else, while I thought she was tending to my check in.  She returned and asked me my name again and began the checkout process.  She offered no apology and failed to give me the correct pool hours, which I learned of after i visited the pool ready for a swim only to learn that it was closed for four hours midday.   The management should train its desk staff to be professional, courteous and to know the basic facts of the hotel's amenities.",pos
"Great price for value. The a/c was cranking when we got to our room. This continued for the duration of the week, and since it was high in the 90's, made for a comfortable night's sleep. The pillows and linens were very snuggly and soft. It felt safe to stay there all by myself. It was a few blocks further away from the beach than I expected. I'm glad I upgraded to the room with the refrigerator.",avg

Nice clean hotel. Stayed several times.,pos
"My wife and I were given room no 135 on first floor (with king bed). The room was old and not fresh - there was a mild odor and carpet was very old too. The ironing board had a burnt top and we started developing itching at night. We called the front desk and got the sheets changed and I immediately posted a bad review. Next day, our room was changed to room 200 in the second floor which was much better, newer and cleaner. Could not complain about that room. Second floor must be newly constructed and so better. Plus they have the decks. For the hotel's prompt action, I am giving a 3 star rating.",avg
My stay overall was good until the final night when I saw the biggest bug I have ever seen crawl across the floor. Hotel staff was notified and unable to move me to another room because all the rooms were booked. Needless to say I hardly slept the entire night after killing this 2 inch long black hardback bug.,pos

We had a very relaxing stay at Brightwood Inn. The room was large and tranquil. We enjoyed the jacuzzi tub. Breakfast was great and they made gluten-free and dairy free accommodations for me.

"further away from Disneyland than we thought, but close to Disney Toy Story parking lot with free shuttle which worked out ok. Pool and hot tub were closed for repair which was a bummer! Free continental breakfast wasn't the greatest, but ok. Room was huge and really nice. King size bed was very comfortable. AC worked great and kept us nice and cool. Would probably stay there again because of great price.",pos
got to the hotel only for them to tell us that one of the rooms that we had booked was not available. they could not do anything for us(we had reservations for 1 king room and one double room). they did give us 2 king rooms so part of my family had to sleep on a pull out couch. then they next day we had the do not disturb sign on the door(in the card slot) and housekeeping ignored it and came into the room and moved all of my daughters' items around. the pool was nice and the breakfast was wonderful with very nice employees taking care the that area.,avg
"This hotel is way over rated, it's nothing like the description or the reviews. Basically its Old (very old) building in the heart of apartment complex/parking lot jungle. Furniture is very old, hotel theme feel like 1850s, clean but old. Tge staff is friendly but you can tell they inexperienced , mostly in there 20s. Room it self spacious but old, old carpet and TV. Bathrooms similar to Motels, bedsheets clean, new sheets, but bed is saggy. Surrounding area is jungle, literally!! Misty and not well kept. Lots traffic once you leave parking. Ppl come from surrounding complex apartments to run on trail. Bottom line, money wasted, will never come again.",neg

"I stayed here with a couple friends the night before doing the Seattle Rock n Roll half marathon. We live a little under an hour away, so we were just coming up for the evening. We called early in the day to inquire about parking and were told that the Inn had their own parking lot so it was no problem to pay to park when we arrived later. Well, when we checked in we were told the parking lot was full, sorry. I was shocked and disappointed that no other explanation or assitance was given. The lady at reception simply handed me a map of some nearby lots and suggested we just park on the street. Well, good luck finding street parking on a Friday evening! We drove around for over an hour until we could find a spot. We then had to move our car in the morning before the race. This was a huge inconvenience. We stopped by hotel reception after driving around for an hour to inquire about late check-out. We were told the hotel doesn't offer late check-out, and even after explaining our frustration about driving around for an hour (or more) looking for parking, she simply said, there's nothing I can do. We were very disappointed in the lack of service, lack of genuine apology, and absence of any sort of gesture for our inconvenience. Needless to say, we will not be back.",neg
Great hotel with fresh cookies free breakfasts very big room with jacuzzi tub in middle of room so great romantic getaway,pos
very hot outside not much interest in sightseeing,pos
"We stayed in a premium suite and while the building is not very attractive (6-floor concrete building), the suite itself was great, brand-new and beautiful with a large tub and a balcony. The resort is really nice, although the beach is far from spectacular, but the pools and common area are pristine. The resort has several restaurants that obviously try to be fancy (no buffet, it's all table service), as well as 24-hr room service, but while service was really good we found the food somewhat hit-or-miss, and (perhaps not surprisingly, but a bit disappointing) lacking any authenticity. Same thing can be said of drinks, pina colada was great but margaritas were incredibly sweet, and at breakfast the orange juice decidedly tasted chemical, not quite fresh. We actually went outside the resort specially to be able to try some real Mexican food! If you don't have a car there is not much around, although there are great snorkeling places within 15 min drive (valet parking is free, which is very convenient). Overall we had a really good time, but I don't think we will be back (first time at an all-inclusive resort, so I can't compare to the competition though)",pos
"check in was friendly and efficient, elevators seemed not to be working properly - only 2 out of 4 were running consistently, rugs in hallways were dated and did not seem very clean, sofa in our suite was dated and the mattress was so old it was unusable as a 3rd bed in the room.",pos

"Easy access to I80, however you can see the sign from the road. Just know it's on the left if your GPS doesn't advise you. Pool was nice, rooms clean and comfy. The only bad thing was we requested a wake up call and never received it and the alarm clock was ridiculous to set and didn't work.",pos
"The only kind person was the woman that cleaned the room. The 2 owners, husband and wife, were absolutely horrible. Their attitudes and customer service skills make me believe they get no return business. I do not recommend anyone to support or subject themselves to these conditions. Your trip will be effected in a negative way.",neg
"After a long drive we went to check into our room. We were looking forward to relaxing and going for a swim. But pool was broken and had been for weeks. And the room was not clean. The towels were paper thin and there were stains on walls, carpet and towels. We had to call and have the dishes brought up to our room and when they arrived there was animal hair on them. We checked out. Called expedia and got a full refund and found another hotel. Staff was apologetic and kind but I will never book with chain again.",neg
"We chose this hotel because Kimpton's have a great reputation and they are pet friendly. Upon arrival (around 9pm) we were disappointed that there was no door staff/valet etc so we ended up taking in the luggage ourselves. When the bellman did see me they didn't offer to help. Check-in was quick and front desk girl was very friendly, greeted Dori by name and offered her a pet package. The room was large and comfortable but there were some areas where you can see the hotel is showing some wear and tear. Overall still very good. All the amenities of a Kimpton including 4pm Kids Hour, 5pm wine hour and most importantly for us Pet Friendly. The hotel was very busy as it was Memorial Day weekend so the restaurant and room service had delays but that's to be expected. I would choose this hotel again especially for the proximity of being in the middle of Old Town, several blocks from the water front and in the midst of amazing restaurants like Restaurant Eve.",pos

"Very happy overall with the hotel, clean comfy room, close to the old part of town. Good choice of food for breakfast. The bar food was good as well. The only downside was the wi-fi was only free for 24hrs. When will hotels get it that everyone now expects good quality free wi-fi as standard",pos

"First trip to Telluride and this is a very nice Hotel with a very Lodge-like feel. However the room accorded us through the Hotels.Com booking was Spartan at best consisting of a bed, a closet, a shower and nothing else! This was unfortunate as occupancy at the lodge/Hotel was not crowded and the Hotel Management staff there certainly had the flexibility to assign a room more representative of the quality at this facility. Wont book there again under these circumstances as lesson has been learned!",neg
"First, the exterior physical appearance was of a well-maintained property. It instantly encouraged me. Next, check-in was mercifully efficient. We found the room to be clean but with one issue which was addressed and corrected immediately. The management of this hotel is the most professional and courteous I have ever encountered. My wife and I travel a lot and we have been disappointed more often than not, but this establishment has exceeded the performance of all others.",pos

I thought the room was a smoking room, but realized that people must use the hallway to smoke (and it really smelled bad) so the smoke drifts into the rooms. Also, there was absolutely no soap in my room at all, not one tiny bar. No shampoo, or lotion or anything. I could live without shampoo, but what hotel doesn't provide a small bar of soap The area is fine and very close to the airport. Hotel clerk was friendly and my room was very adequate for the price.",avg

"The Metropole hotel and our experience there was perfect. The hotel is on the Grand Canal near one of the Alilaguna/treghetti stops, so you can easily walk from public transportation from the airport. They have their own water taxi dock as well. The hotel itself is like a museum. It's like staying in an ancient but updated Venetian home. Service was impeccable. The employees are friendly, helpful, competent, and nice. The room was beautiful and clean. We didn't have much of a view, and the window was small so the room was dark. Room servicing was great. It was serviced twice a day. Facilities were clean and worked. We had breakfast there, and again the experience was perfection. We just wanted to spend the day sitting there, munching on fresh yogurt, fruit, pastries, and the best mozzarella balls anywhere. The hotel is also about a block from St. Mark's Square, and there is an ATM about 1/2 a block away. The street is lined with restaurants. This prime tourist area. Pack light if it's your first trip to Venice, there are no motorized vehicles in the city so you schlepp your bags...or take a water taxi and get dropped right at the hotel's doorstep.

"Filthy kitchen, filthy fridge, filthy oven, filthy living room, lumpy uneven beds, only one towel for a room with four guests and two beds, no continental breakfast (despite the sign outside saying so,) no batteries in the TV remote, no mat to wipe your feet save for a shredded up towel that was soaked through by the rain anyway.Leaks all over the bathroom, there was a puddle from the moment we walked in.To top it all off, they refused to do a refund despite us staying in the room for only 2 hours, and didn't try moving to another room (like I would trust the hotel anymore.) They said the cutoff time for a full refund was 20 minutes. Or at least that's what they told me three days later. It was Saturday and they told me there wouldn't be a manager until Monday morning (I ended up calling Tuesday at noon, no manager showed up on Monday.)Those two hours were spent unpacking the car, debating whether or not we should leave, and above all, taking pictures of the whole mess.I'll be disputing this with my bank.

"We had a single king size bedroom.  It was quite large with many places to sit as well as a large bathroom.  Everything was in good shape considering the age of the hotel.  The bed was very comfortable as my back was aching when I got to the room from the drive.  The hotel has a restaurant inside.  Prices were typical of a fancier place $12 for sandwich with side $15-25 for an entry.  I went to get food shortly after I arrived at the hotel and found a 10% off coupon for the restaurant and two free drink coupons on top of the two free breakfast coupons which we used the next day.  My wife and I slept well for the first time in a long time as we didn't have the kids with us.  Breakfast in the morning was different.  They only open up half of the restaurant and you had to wait to be seated.  Our wait was about 15 minutes, a couple with their two kids must have waited nearly 25-30 minutes to get a seat.  And this was for a buffet style breakfast.  I am use to a more sit yourself and help yourself approach.  Maybe this way they can take special orders for guests that don't want the normal buffet.  It seemed a little backwards as breakfast ended at 10:30 AM checkout was at 11:00 AM so if you didn't know you were going to have to wait that long you might miss out.  Other than that we had a good time.  The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful.  I would definitely stay here again.",pos

So I couldn't look things up and I could not send my work via internet at all during my stay. The breakfast in the restaurant was about the worst I have ever had, and the price made it even harder to swallow. JUST GROSS- we had the buffet. We chose Bay City only because my husband wanted to book a NICE HOTEL which now seems like a huge mistake. I have traveled all around the US and stay in various hotels. This was very clean, but other than that it was a huge waste of our money. For the price of these rooms I expected a great deal more. A balcony for sure when your paying for a river view.

I travelled with my elderly mother and although the hotel has a lot of steps she was able to manage well. Staff are universally friendly and helpful. There is a small selection of bar meals which was very good. The cost of food and drinks is very reasonable considering the surroundings and service. We never ate dinner in the main restaurant but the breakfast had an excellent choice everything from full cooked English to fresh fruit, natural local yoghurt and lots of cereals or pastries. The Cava on ice was a nice touch. The rooms are modern but with an old world charm, from the1930s () marble style bathrooms to solid wood writing desks and comfortable arm chairs. Comfortable beds, plenty of hot water and wifi in the rooms. Overall the decor and furnishing in this hotel speaks of solid old fashioned quality in a modern well-run establishment. Sure if you look at your feet as you walk, you will see the odd threadbare carpet in the corridors but it completely fits with the feel of a well-loved lived in country mansion that isn polished from top to bottom daily. The lay-out of the public areas around the foyer was very homely.....arranged in such a way with plants, rugs and large pieces of antique () furniture that each section felt like your own private sitting room and even when the hotel was busy, it never felt crowded.

"Terrible time. We made reservations in advanced. Downstairs was specified. At check in they had us upstairs. 2 disabled people. Bad knees. No elevator. They did have a smaller room downstairs. Because I went through a 3 rd party, they said I had call and cancel previous reservation. Too much trouble. We were so disappointed. There was plenty of time for them to notify us about not having a downstairs room. We only found 1 ice machine downstairs in the lobby. Wasn't given the password for wifi. Not a happy time.",avg

"This is a very old hotel with a fresh coat of paint. I mostly booked this hotel because it is the cheapest in town. The rooms are not bad but the bath tub water will be brown with rust for the first few seconds when you turn it on. Both elevators are also old and need to be replaced. They are slow, falling apart, creaky and honestly a little scary. The hotel staff is nice though and they have free breakfast. They breakfast is not the best (bananas that are both green and black, small pastries, cereal dispensers that don't work, reconstituted coffee) but it is free.",avg
"The front desk and management we dealt we were very poor. Every simple request required multiple phone calls, and they placed us in a room directly across from daily construction which lasted past 8pm on two occasions, even though we had an infant with us who needed to nap and go to bed early at night. When we asked a manager if we could change rooms, she declined and told us it would end at 5pm that day and there would be no more for the remainder of our trip. It lasted two more full days, and she conveniently had the next day off so we could not address it with her. Also, the check-in process was awful as they made us wait three hours in the hot and humid conditions for our room. However, the restaurants (and their staff) are excellent. I can't say enough about the staff at Blue, as they were extremely friendly and always went out of their way to put a smile on everyone's face. The food at all three dinner restaurants (as well as Chil for lunch) was very good, and service was mostly great throughout. Our room itself was very clean, and the pool areas are fantastic. Also, room service was very fast and was also delicious. It was a shame that the front desk dropped the ball on so many occasions because it really could have been an awesome trip, but it was unfortunately blemished by poor customer service on the front end.",pos
The hallway had over a dozen green trash bags and a dolly just left there. Doors etc were in disrepair. Hotels.com said it was pet friendly but when I got to the office there was a big sign NO PETS.

i arrived late at night about 11:30 as this was the halfway point on a trip after being up since 430 that am and working all day and then leaving for my trip. all i wanted was a good clean room to sleep and this room fit the bill. the only downside was that the tv reception was horrible in the room in fact all you could do was hear the sound and not see the pic on any channell. this did not matter to me since all i wanted to do was go to sleep anyway. i did mention it to the from desk when leaving in the am and hopefully the tv has been fixed and this is not a reception problem for the entire facility. my room number as i recall was 115 so avoid that room or at least ask to see the room and check the tv reception. breakfast was the usual continental and was ok,avg

I had read some of the earlier reviews, and had stayed here in the past, so I was expecting nothing more than a bed to sleep in while travelling. But it was a very pleasant stay. The staff were very friendly and helpful. I had booked the room for one night heading east, and before I left I booked a room for my return trip. They gave me the same room, which was in a convenient location and there was very little noise from the floor above or other rooms on the floor I was located on. I would have no problem recommending this hotel to anyone travelling through Worthington, MN.",pos

The room had a gas smell to me, that never went away. Toilet how low can you go, hold on to something when your about to use the toilet.

A certain charm and a great location but overloaded decor and a few annoying details like the nonstop easy listening music in the dining/sitting area and limited breakfast time slot (8:30-9:30).

Room had cob webs in room with dead bugs on ceiling. Exhaust fan in bathroom caked with dirt. Dark walls needed painting and needs updating . Carpets in hotel filthy.,avg
"The staff were outstanding! Truly a 5 star staff! As for the hotel itself, it is obvious that it's an old hotel. And in need of updating. (New carpet, some minor wall damage throughout hallways, etc.) But it is also obvious that said changes are taking place. A new swimming pool is being added on the 2nd floor, etc. This was my 1st art show in Richmond, and the hotel was about 7 minutes from the venue. Which made it so much easier to get well rested and be at my best. The morning breakfast was wonderful as well. But I must say, the staff at this location ARE 5 star! After the upgrades, I fully expect this hotel to have a 5 start rating! I just hope they continue to be as reasonable with their rates!",avg

"Good food, pleasant staff, well maintained, but pricey for what you get. I wouldn't upgrade to swim up or club Excellence room as perks not worth it and all rooms are basically the same inside just some beach views and perks For example the swim up is just a 1st floor room where you can walk out through the slider to the pool area but there is a hammock in the way which isn't removable and you can't go around it so you have to crawl under it, very awkward. Other swim up room amenities include a standard size jet tub outside your slider which no one uses as you have a big jet tub in your room and outside tub has little privacy. Club Excellence just has a separate pool area which is the same as all other pools and some nicer(but not much nicer) seating and lounges on the club beach area. Also when they come around for drinks they offer snacks like shrimp. Also a small club only room where you can get drinks and food but resort has many restaurants so not a big perk to me. All level rooms I saw have a step down to the slider inside the room which is unsafe fall feature. The entertainment is weak but some of the musicians were pretty good. Need more activities. Beach is narrow and was covered with seaweed, a common problem for the area. I give the place a 3.5 to 4 stars out of 5.",pos

The hotel is beautiful from every angle hands down. Unfortunately the front desk staff isn't so helpful or professional in how they handle issues which many have. They will go back and fourth with you regarding their policy etc but never show any type of compassion or customer service when its needed most. I would NEVER go back because without customer service a business can never be what I need as a paying customer. Long check in process and lines along with very little options for lunch and dinning late at night. Beautiful but so not worth all the other headaches and disappointments.,avg

"Great location, fantastic staff, very clean rooms, charming historical property, and great price! Breakfast vouchers for panera bread across the street. Cons: tiny showers and very low shower heads (5ft) - some rooms have bathrooms are not in the room, but across the public hall and you need a separate key to enter. Beds are very firm and creak when you move in them. Noise carries here. It's easy to hear your neighbors conversation in their room, but the guests were all very considerate. The place is over 100 years old and hasn't been remodelled, so it's pretty dated, but I will say it's kept immaculately clean! Not one spec of dust or dirt! Overall this place had the perfect location, outstanding staff, cozy historic charm, and great breakfast. The price is great for the area and hotels.com had an even better deal! The pros definitely outweigh the cons and the staff will do everything they can to accommodate for you. We will absolutely be returning for another stay in the future!",pos

I have stayed at many Hampton Inns and this was by far the worst I have ever encountered. We were locked out of our room for at least an hour because of a faulty security lock.

"You can't beat the location. Old Town Alexandria is charming, and the hotel is right in the middle of it. There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. The restaurant next to the hotel is a bit spendy, but pretty good. The room itself was a bit small, and I would have liked a lock on the bathroom door, but the beds and pillows were comfy, and the TV service adequate. Going into downtown D.C. was ~50 minutes door-to-door (to White House) by metro. I feel the hotel should offer a shuttle to the metro. We had to taxi, since the King street trolley only runs from 11AM - 7PM--walking to the metro, while doable at 20m, would have made for a tiring day touring D.C. The parking garage is old and space is tight, so a couple nights we had to pay to park elsewhere, but its workable. Most staff were nice, but a few times the staff were slightly less than helpful: room service comes too late in the day, and kept harassing us even though our child was napping and we asked them to come back later. One day while it was pouring rain outside, we tried to borrow an extra umbrella from the doorman (we're a family of 4 with 2 young kids), and were rebuffed [??]. But, the kids hour and wine hour are great, and the hotel is fun. Bottom line, the location is great, and the charm of the hotel and the surrounding area make some of the small inconveniences insignificant.",pos

"We were given the worst rooms in the house. I believe it's because we booked through Expedia. We had a family of 7 in two rooms, both rooms were handicap versions, no tubs for kids, and located at extreme opposite ends of the hotel. They claimed it was due to being extremely full, despite booking months in advance and giving them two warnings of our arrival 24 hrs prior and morning of. Handicap rooms were totally inappropriate with small children. They made zero effort to put us close together. Do not recommend for families. Dining room is too formal, and they do not allow children in the lounge. Room service wasn't perfect. Asked for wine with 4 glasses and a bucket of ice. They brought 3 glasses and no ice. They charged a late evening service charge for room service before 8 pm. Won't return I'm afraid.",avg

"This past Friday was my wedding, which took place at The Abbey Resort, and I can't say enough good things about this place! Our wedding took place in the gazebo by the West Shore Pavilion, and the reception was in the pavilion. It was beautiful, quiet, and quaint, just as we'd hoped, and we loved that we were able to go right from our ceremony to cocktail hour to our reception without taking transportation. Our guests thoroughly enjoyed themselves, and they all thought the resort was one of the nicest places they've stayed, from the rooms to the amenities. I want to give a special thanks for Robyn Moe, our wedding coordinator, who was amazing throughout the whole process of planning our wedding. She answered all of our e-mails and phone calls very promptly, and she made sure that our day was just as we'd imagined it. I can't thank her enough for bearing with us, especially towards the end when I was getting overwhelmed and had to change some things in a matter of days. She even picked me up in a golf cart to drive me from my room to the reception tent right before the ceremony when my husband asked her if she could. Also, Justin Juntunen, who helped us book our room and block of room for our guests, was awesome and was always there to answer e-mails promptly and take care of any situations we needed help with. I also want to thank Tauna, from the Avani Spa in The Abbey resort. She did my hair trial and my hair on they day of the wedding, and she was absolutely incredible at making my hair look just like the picture from Pinterest that I showed her. She was also very friendly, kind, and she made me feel very at ease on the day of the wedding. She is truly talented at what she does, and I wouldn't want anyone else to do my hair on the day of my wedding :). When we decided to book our wedding at The Abbey, we were given a list of their preferred vendors, and that made it super easy to find quality vendors! We loved everything about this place. :)",pos

"Our stay was wonderful and exceeded our expectations. The personal touches were exquisite and unexpected, from greeting us by name as we got out of the car, to the personalized treats left on our bed at turn down. The food was delightful and there was always something delicious to nibble on in the living room. The room was expensive yet not overpriced. The bedding was luxurious. We have stayed at many 5 star hotels and this was by far the most welcoming and attentive. We stayed at the Ritz last year and it can't hold a candle to the service received at the Simpson Inn.",pos

There's nothing wrong with the hotel except that there are flood lights shining in your window while you sleep and the curtains don't close. I really like the furniture The bedding was clean the pillows are great. Next time I will ask for a room with windows on the other side.,avg
Only complaint is lack of coffee maker in the room (and lobby!) and the noise level between rooms. Nothing too bad but you definitely know when someone is next store.

Unexpected cleanliness for the rate. Friendly staff. Continental breakfast can be better.,pos
"Typical chain hotel. Everything was adequate but not much wow. The room temperature was hard to control. Was most comfortable when we just turned it off. The bathroom was small, very dark and very outdated. The complementary breakfast was especially nice. There was a great variety of options and the lobby area where the breakfast was served was comfortable and very nicely decorated. It didn't ever work for us to be there for the complimentary happy hour but we appreciated that it was offered. Despite being near the airport we were never aware of any noise from planes. Most of the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful.",pos
"The room had a funky layout, but it was reasonable clean and comfortable. The parking garage was a positive.",avg
"This small restaurant is casual by day, see and be seen by night. The lunch menu is reasonably priced, and the selling point is the wood oven-baked pizzas.

"I was not impressed by this hotel. The room was dingy, outdated and not as clean as I would expect. The bathroom vanity was chipped along with the door and the grout between shower tiles was stained. The carpeting throughout the room was likely vacuumed, however it felt dirty to me. The armchair in the room was also very old, not even sure why they would keep it there in its frayed condition. Overall, it was fine for 1 quick nights stay, however I would not book this hotel again in the future. I did enjoy the company of the cricket (yes, live cricket) who greeted me on the nightstand upon my arrival! :)",neg

I had a flight out of JAX and looked for a place to leave me car. This place was great! Close to restaurants and a gas station. The shuttle ride to the airport was about 10 minutes.

It was fairly clean but definitely could use new linens and paint job. Carpet could be cleaned or replaced. Bathroom floor was old and over years of wiping with a mop, could stand a good bleaching. In the morning, they were just setting up breakfast at close to 9:00 a.m. Coffee was not hot and tasted like it might have been from day before.",neg
It was a short stay but it was that her enjoyable. Oh room had the kitchen and it was nice to be able to make our own meals. There was no oven so don't plan on baking anything.

"I was impressed with this hotel. It was clean, quiet and staff was pleasant. You are even offered a warm cookie upon checkin in which I took full advantage of. I paid under 100 for the night and it was an awesome deal. It's is about 15 minutes from the City Walk where you can shop and eat. The hotel shuttle takes you to and from the airport and City Walk for free. However, it does not take you to the beach. You will need to take a taxi there. Other than that, I have no complaints on my stay. I highly recommend this hotel.",pos
"Great weekend skiing in Jackson, it was below zero every night. I had the heat turned down as far as it would go and it would still kick on every once in a while. The room tended to be slightly warmer than I wanted anyway. Not the fanciest hotel, but comfortable. The way the rooms are set up you may hear people walking in ski boots on the upstairs deck and down the stairs in the mornings. Not a huge concern to me but some people may not like that.",pos

I went to see my son graduate from bootcamp with the Army. He had to be back on base by 7:45 p.m. so this hotel being 15 minutes away was perfect. The drive to and from the base was quick and easy. Slept great. All was good,pos

I would stay there again.",pos
"Check in was prompt and uneventful. Breakfast was corporate traveler average with hot and cold selections. A small tray of freshly baked cookies were available for one hour at 5pm. There was a refrigerator, but no microwave, unless you chose to use the one in the lobby breakfast area. Wifi was fine. The side door to the heated pool and spa was adjacent to a smoker's station and often propped so the room keycard security was defeated. The hotel location was very good for access to I-95 and the Beeline Expressway to the Gulf Coast, however evening commuter traffic on the I-95 south of our location was very bad, due to construction, so check traffic websites and plan alternate routes accordingly. We visited several local attractions and drove along the coastline roads to explore the area for a future visit, so this worked well for us.",avg
"We wanted a king bed and was told we had a room with 2 queens. The desk rep was very condescending when she said the king was based on availability and since I had only made my reservation 12 days ago, I was probably on the bottom of the list. There was a long line to get into the 2 available elevators to go to floors 16 to 32. There are actually 3 elevators but one was stopped on the 2nd floor the entire time. Poor planning to only have 2 available at check in. To get to the pool, you have to either walk all across the lobby or through part of the casino to get to the elevator. Pool area was dirty with cigarette butts.",neg

"First of all the pictures of the hotel property gave us the impression that this is right next to the lake, which is what we were looking for...Its NOT! The property is at least 7 blocks away from the lake the closest beach is the Country Club that you have to pay an arm a leg for a family to go but only after you complete the formal paper request process to enter their property. So we opted for the indoor pool on the property to take our children. DISGUSTING! It was super cloudy (couldn't even see the 2nd step) wreaked a disgusting smell in the enclosed room with no ventilation (as the 4 sliding glass doors are barred shut). Seriously disappointed, we go back to the room to finish our horrible day my husband sits down on the only comfy chair in the room, the numerous exposed nails in the upholstery cut his arm open. So needless to say we will never, ever return to this property. We've used Hotels.com for many years and haven't ever been unhappy or complained about a hotel property once, until this one. Terrible experience!",neg

Paris is a cramped city. So finding a huge room with excess corners and space is hard. Hotel de Neuville had extremely comfortable beds and a spacious bathroom. The room was a little tiny but the organization of the room made it spacious. Rooms were always tidy. I would definitely stay there again. The location was perfect. Only steps away from the metro and RER line. It is very easy to locate on a map. The staff was phenomenal. Some of the absolute best customer service I have ever had in Europe. Our car was hit in the parking garage and the hotel attendant call the corporate office of the parking garage to translate and have the parking garage fill out the necessary paperwork. Just wonderful customer service. The breakfast was great as well. And the design of the hotel is wonderful. They have plenty of enjoyable art on display.,pos

"The staff was nice, the only good part of the experience. The hotel is in shabby, questionable shape. We had to take it as it was the only place accepting pets and we didn't have the energy to continue the day's journey. Poorly kept up, halls are dark and freezing, the property is aging and ridiculously neglected by the ownership. While I wasn't interested in a jetted tub, the listing touts it as a feature in their rooms, which is completely untrue. Not only was the tub not jetted, I didn't even want to use the tub or shower at all. I don't go into a standard motel with unfair expectations, but to pay 100 dollars for a dive is incredibly disappointing. Like I said, the staff was the only highlight. It's a shame they are saddled with having to work for a property owner with no interest in presenting a decent experience. Do your best to stay at one of the other nearby hotels in the vicinity in order to get any value for your money.",neg
There was no refrigerator in room and no ice machine on the premises. There was no iron and no pad or cover on the ironing board. Also one of the queen beds was missing the blanket and bed skirt.

"Pleasantly surprised as to how nice this renovated hotel looked. The room was beautifully appointed, had a blue accent wall hardly seen in this price range and was good sized. Bathroom was super small but CLEAN and manageable. The only refurbishing that stills needs to be done would be the whirlpool. We were concerned about noise from regional airport or the interstate right behind the hotel but neither were an issue, my only complaint would be the loudness of the air conditioner in room. Had to turn up/down volume in tandem with the AC. Breakfast selections plentiful and the area is constantly being cleaned and refilled. We found this hotel very convenient to getting into Hartford as it is one light off I-91, at the V towards I-84 heading to Manchester and even south to wethersfield and elsewhere. I would return to this hotel again in a heartbeat. Price drives where we stay when we visit our granddaughter every 3 months.

"I reserved this room as a stopover on a long trip. I arrived late (after 10 pm) and was pleasantly pleased that it took about a minute and a half to check in. The rooms have exterior entrances, and there is a ramp up to the second floor which is convenient. The room was big and clean with fridge and microwave. Sink and mirror separate from shower. The hairdryer wasn't working in the morning and when I reported it, I received another one in about 5 minutes. It isn't fancy, but it was a pleasant surprise. No complaints.",pos
Room service tried to come in twice when we were sleeping in the morning. With the do not disturbed sign up. They were unprofessional and walked into our room. I will never go back and I would spend the extra 10 for a motel 6.,neg

The staff I interacted with, especially Kirsten) was very friendly. The included continental breakfast was what you would expect. The remote for the TV did not work and I was provided with another one and instructions on how to program it. It didn't work either. The bathroom did not get the attention that most people would expect. It was dusty, and had hairs on the floor upon my arrival. When I returned at the end of the day after room service, they were still there. That could have been better. The price was decent, but I would shop the competitors before choosing to stay here again.",avg

"I usually don't leave reviews, but thought I would this time. I had to find a last minute hotel, and everything else was so expensive. I normally wouldn't stay in a Best Western, as it seems pretty old school. I was pleasantly surprised. The room is nothing to speak about - it is pretty old and the microwave was really old (not that I used it - it was just funny), but overall it was just fine. I am going to keep this one in my back pocket if I get in a pinch again. The gentleman at the front desk was nice and helpful, he put me in a quiet room facing the neighborhood out back, and I slept fine.",pos
Overall is was a good stay. Clean rooms and the restrooms were clean also.,pos
Staff was very friendly and helpful and the price and location were perfect The hotel could use minor repairs but overall I would and will be a repeat quest,avg
Hotel was not up to date with today's standards. 2 stories but no elevator. Our room did not have a closet and lighting was inadequate. Air conditioner was very loud. Refrigerator doors on wrong side - hard to access. Each unit is individually owned and furnished. Hotel staff used this as an excuse for any complaint. More details need to be listed in Hotel Amenities so that potential guests can make an informed decision. Could have requested ground floor with closet if had known.,neg
"We have no complaints. Nice and clean. They have a pretty good complimentary breakfast. The staff is nice and helpful. They have a nice swimming area that is removed from the guest rooms. The breakfast does not offer much of a variety, but it was filling and tasty.",pos

Small, old furniture and carpet, ugly walls that need paint.

"I was assured by the very pleasant front desk staff that my room was non-smoking, in fact I signed an agreement that I would not smoke in the room. My room reeked of smoke. It was a mild smell when I first went in so I unpacked and then opened the bathroom door. The bathroom was so awful I could hardly stand to be in there. When I called the desk they said yes they knew. Sorry but they had not control over that. The manager was unapologetic. I have reason to visit Rohnert Park often, but will never stay here again.",neg

Gave us a regular double queen instead of suite with king size bed. One of bed covers has 2 holes. Staff could have corrected room but to fix room would mean switching to room at back of building. Shower does not have a hand held and shower head not very good if trying to give shower to children. Nonetheless bed was comfy and breakfast decent.,neg
Well walked it to room smelling like gas and infested with roaches. Ceiling and ceiling fans we're full of cob webs didn't look anything like what was advertised online. It was disgusting. I will not stay again,neg
"Excellent location near to major sites, great neighborhood. Staff was very good, except for one lady at reception who was not helpful with trying to adjust temperature of room. Head of breakfast staff was efficient, but a little abrupt. We stayed during first 2 weeks in November. Air conditioning had been turned off and our room and daughter's room were too hot. Hotel didn't have fans. Windows had no screens, so opening them to cool off the rooms let in mosquitoes. This was probably not an unusual problem since rooms had plug in insect repellent units. Maid service was excellent. All in all, the hotel was expensive, but worth it. The junior suite was well appointed. I understand that the star rating in Europe is different than the U.S. If you wanted year round air conditioning, you probably need a 5 star rated European hotel.",pos
Staff was very friendly and accomadating. Nice view on river side. Quiet. Would stay again if in the area.,pos

Stayed a couple of nights while visiting family in Chicago. The hotel is clean and comfortable. The bed linens and pillows were very nice. The kids enjoyed the pool. Breakfast was about what you expect... But they had an automatic pancake maker! My favorite part of the hotel! (Although everything else was great too),pos
"I was very impressed with this hotel, and would gladly stay again. The TV channel selection was very good, and the free continental breakfast was nice. The wi-fi worked very well, and I was able to order in a pizza without issue. I was able to hear some noise from both Dulles airport at times, and other guests across the hall, but for the most part it was quiet. I noticed some slight damage to the hotel room itself, but nothing major. Having the free shuttle to Dulles airport was a huge plus as well. The hotel itself is in a nice neighborhood, but is kind of out in the country a bit. If you would like to site see, the best thing to do would be to take a cab.",pos
"Stayed at Beach Cove with a group of friends for spring break. We were put on the 11th floor which gave us a perfect view in the morning. The room was nice, clean, and well maintained.

"Stayed based on price and proximity to family we were visiting. There is a security issue. The parking garage is dark and not easily seen if there's a problem, and the door into hotel says to use room key - but not only do you not need a key, the door doesn't even latch, and it appears a new handle was put in place to override the latch/lock handle. Interior is accessable to anyone and there did appear to be someone in the garage area who didn't seem to have any business there. We could park in front and go in that way, the room was big enough and comfortable, but this security issue isn't worth saving a few when there are reasonable and good hotels nearby.",avg

It was less than 5 minutes from Mon Ami where we ate Friday night and less than 5 minutes from the African Safari Park that we enjoyed Saturday morning.

We were very very disappointed and said as much to the hotel clerk who simply shook her head and made a frowning face. We were not offered any kind of compensation. They advertised as a superior deluxe king which was a far cry from the new traveling Red Roof Inn promotional truck that goes from festival to festival promoting the new superior quality rooms.

The hotel is pet friendly so we saw some pretty cool dogs and surprisingly we didn't hear any barking at night ( I was a little concerned about that). There's so much to see and do within walking distance. We valeted our car for $25 and walked everywhere. So overall it's a great place to stay. A few little critiques: 1. Some of the fixtures in our room we loose or broken. 2. The fridge is locked and you have to ask for the key. Kinda odd. It's stocked full of wine, beer and liquor, plus some snacks and even socks! BUT there's no room to put anything of your own in there ( I know, I know, it's wet bar, but one shelf would be great).

"We have stayed at comfort inns before and have been very satisfied with our stay. However, our stay at the Bend comfort inn got off to a rocky start. We were greeted with a less than friendly clerk at the check in desk. Tanya asked me three different times during the check in process how many keys we would need, obviously not listening to my answer. She spoke so low and fast I could not hear her when she told us where to find the Internet code to access the wifi in our room and she acted annoyed that she had to repeat where to find it. Not once during our interaction did she ever say thank you. Although the VERY small room was clean, there were items that were worn out that I would have thought would have been replaced. The toilet seat was worn and unsightly. The sheets on one of the beds had small and worn out holes. On the positive side of the stay, the breakfast was not too bad for a free hotel meal. The woman in charge of the breakfast was great and very friendly. We were there for a basketball tournament over the weekend and she made sure to tell all the families who were there for the tournament that she would start breakfasts earlier than normal so that teams that had early games could still get breakfast. Overall, a nice stay with the exception of the first front desk clerk.",pos

"We booked for a July stay based on an affordable rate, location, and the generally positive reviews we'd seen. The staff was pleasant upon check-in, but we were a bit disappointed with the old feeling of the room, lack of light in the shower, etc. We were out and about most of the afternoon and evening, and when I pulled back the covers to get in bed at about 11:30, a reddish-brown bug was trying to scurry out of sight. I caught it and confirmed in an online image search that it was indeed a bedbug. We tore up the covers and found another. Out of curiosity, we looked at the other bed in the room and didn't see any, but we did notice it was wrapped in a mattress cover that our bed didn't have...perhaps evidence that someone knew there was a problem (which obviously wasn't eradicated) We'd heard bedbug infestation horror stories so we packed everything up, called the night manager to tell her we would be seeking alternate accommodations and dropped our key in the slot. The night manager advised us to talk to another manager in the morning. The next morning my husband talked to the manager and although she was reluctant to give us a complete refund (citing Expedia fees, etc), she did agree and we received a refund. After returning home from our trip we called to request additional compensation for our trouble of leaving to find another (more expensive) hotel at midnight but not surprisingly didn't get a response. Fortunately we didn't bring any bugs home with us.",neg
"We have a 4 months old baby and although the hotel provided us with a crib, I do not recommend it for very young children. The views are breathtaking, cliff side overlooking the ocean, but the whole resort is build on a hill and it's impossible to navigate it with a stroller, or walk (unless you love the stair-master machine at the gym). So no long walk after dinner with the stroller to calm down baby. Our building also had a hot water problem, and they started digging a huge whole right in front of it (making sure the shuttles couldn't drive to our building). We spent 4 days without hot water, taking cold showers and boiling water on the stove top to give baby a bath. Ridiculous. The hotel didn't offer any compensation, discount or new room. Also, you cannot swim in the ocean, so pool only.",avg

The Hotel is in a great location-5 block walk to beach, boardwalk, restaurants, shops and entertainment. The pool was nice with not many people there. All in all experience was fine-I would probably return because the price was good and the only bad thing was the showers.",pos
"I've stayed in dozens of hotels. I like to try to stay away from your typical franchise hotels. This was the worst I've experienced. When I arrived it had great vibes. Seemed nice, valet were awesome. Honestly the only bright spot. The girl at the front desk was nice enough to let us check in early. She didnt reccomend anything. Didnt pass along any information about anything local. Maybe said 20 words total. We arrived early because of a blizzard and wanted to beat the bad weather. After that it was down hill. We found two staples sticking out of the carpet with our bare feet. We headed down to the hot tub, which is an essential perk when staying away from home, we might as well have jumped in the snow bank. It was frigid. The pool wasn't any better. So we headed right back to our room upset.The overall feel of the hotel is hit or miss. Feels run down in parts and nice in others. We didn't eat at the restaurant because it didn't feel right. My final thought and where I feel we got our moneyes worth... the elevator.. it was something out of universal studios. Half the time we ended up on the wrong floor it made horrible noises and we weren't sure we would survive the ride. A rush for sure. Our next trip to battle Creek won't be spent staying here.",neg

"This hotel is not worthy of the limp Tom name. The staff was very nice but it stops there. I booked this hotel because it has a 4.5 rating and is a VIP + hotel on Expedia. It's a 3 star hotel at best and never once did I get a VIP treatment. To the contrary I think that since I booked through Expedia they have me the worst possible room in the entire hotel. Room was like a Marriott room which is fine but nothing special. It was next to the maintenance entrance so there was loud noise constantly. It was not prepared for my arrival and there was some kind of leak so an entire section of carpet was soaking wet. I would not recommend this hotel to anybody. I am also beginning to think that booking hotels through Expedia is a bad idea because I always get treated worse if I do. I'm a gold member w Expedia and I always get shafted when I book with them.

"Let me start by saying it was my fault for hastily booking a room and not reading the reviews. We simply wanted somewhere to rest for the night before we headed back home. When i pulled up I was so disappointed. The outside looked like a hotel you rent by the hour. The inside of the room was terrible. Water did not work properly, there were no towels, there were stains on the couch, chair and floor. It was so bad I didn't even let me two year old sit on the furniture. This was supposed to be a non smoking room however it smelled like smoke. There were also cigarette burns on the wall. The shower didn't work and it looked like bed and the frame needed to be replaced. We didn't bother to stay. After 20 minutes we packed our bags and left. The front desk staff said we were unable to get our money back and gave us the run around about the room being used therefore no refund. I even called the owner and Expedia and they both gave me the run around. This place should be shut down. No one should live here. This hotel should not even be listed on Expedia. Again i was in a rush and i didn't read the reviews so it is truly my fault. But a place like this should not be allowed to advertise.",neg

"I have used this location for years but this last stay was very stressful. My 3 night reservation specified a late check in a king room in a quiet area. I was given a room directly across from the elevator ,that smelled of urine - unacceptable. There were no other king rooms so I moved to a double was told that I could move to a new king room the next day when several guests checked out. Not a problem. Day 2 - Next morning, I stopped by the desk to confirm the day staff knew of the proposed room change. I said I understood this couldn't occur until after rooms became available housekeeping was done cleaning rooms. The woman at the desk was snarky, said there were no king rooms available house keeping wasn't done. I pointed out that I understood was there to confirm the day staff understood the situation. She said she would make sure the change was taken care of. Later in the evening, I called the hotel to confirm my king room was secured was told my room was ready. When I returned to the hotel that night, I went to my new room found they had given me another double! When I finally did get my king room there was no soap but fortunately, I had packed my own. 3 nights, 4 different rooms! The only thing that made my latest stay at the hotel bearable is that with the exception of the one snarky lady - Delores- everyone else on the staff (front desk housekeeping) was genuine, friendly and made me feel welcome.

Since I was not happy about that, he then checked to see what he could do and found a room with a king bed. Kudos to him for that but the room must have had pets in it previously because every time I stood still on the carpet, something would bite me. I assume it must have been fleas so rather than go through the hassle of changing rooms, I did not stand still on the carpet and thankfully the critters didn't follow me home. I told the girl at the desk about the issue so hopefully the room was properly cleaned and treated. Shame on the pet owners who bring their bug infested pets into a hotel room making it worse for the next guest.",avg

Rating is based on a management decision. Now I understand the 24 hour cancellation rule but we had a vehicle breakdown and couldn't make it. It was expensive enough without an extra room charge. Will go elsewhere next time.,neg
We had a relaxing time on the beach staying at the Hampton. Linda was a joy to see every morning in the breakfast area. Her friendly greeting and helpful nature made breakfast enjoyable.

"Very well-maintained hotel with many amenities, especially for the price point: free Wi-Fi indoor pool free continental breakfast with a variety of selections. Friendly staff, immaculately clean public areas and comfortable, welcoming rooms with modern decor. Located in a Hotel Row, the Fairfield Inn Saginaw is situated within the city's main shopping cluster, so it literally sits between two shopping plazas and slightly across from the mall. Great for shopping, eating and freeway access, but not too great for view, thus the 4 versus 5 rating (my view was the parking lot of two anchor stores, Big Lots and Hobby Lobby). That's the most minor of issues, however, especially when traveling for business. I would absolutely stay here again and will recommend the hotel to others in the future.",pos

The first night there was a high school soccer team staying overnight and the second night a college volleyball team. Although the hotel was quite busy both of these teams were not the problem, but rather other quests who were wandering the halls, banging doors, yelling, cursing and generally acting obnoxiously.

"Awful, awful, awful!!! On our trip from FL to VT we had stayed at a Hampton the previous night and it was just exceptional, so we sought out another Hampton Inn along our trip. We were traveling with our 2 non-shedding very well behaved medium sized dogs and were told at check in that there would be a 75 pet fee per dog! There was no indication of this online at all. The check in clerk stated that they were having problems with dogs so just changed their policy to charge a fee, and she was nice enough to only charge us for one pet - 75.00. Are you kidding We were then put in one of the pet rooms which shared a wall with the elevator and that's exactly what we heard the entire night, the elevator going up and down. We asked to be moved but was told there are only so many pet friendly rooms and there were no other rooms available. Pet friendly You must mean pet tolerant since in no way was this hotel pet friendly. On top of that I could not get the room to cool off and the air conditioner made a horrible noise the entire night. What a change from the Hampton Inn in Columbia, SC that we stayed the night before, a real gem! I would never stay at this hotel again.",neg

(butternut squash tender and mild, real mashed potatoes whipped with attitude, ..delicious...ummm, when's my next celebration, ....The Lobby is definitely on my pick list.",avg
Overall the experience was pleasant and relaxing. The food was good. 99 of the staff were friendly and helpful. The services at the spa were dreamy. The front desk staff were lackluster in customer service at check in and check out. The room we booked was unavailable and they initially downgraded us (family of 4 with 3 people 6 feet tall and over) and added roll away beds. But after a stern discussion the next day we got much better accommodations. Timeshare sales people were pushy for the first 3 days but then backed off. Pools were nice. View was amazing. Waking and falling asleep to the lapping of the ocean - priceless.,pos

"We had a street view. There is construction going on extending the streetcar. Not the hotels fault, but they do start at 7am. If you plan on sleeping in past 7 do not get the street view. Also we had a Sysco delivery truck pull up out front at 5:00 am on our last day, the trucks engine ran until 6:15am then the driver got out his hand truck and loaded the hand truck, scanning every box, making a very loud noise. There should be a back or side entrance for deliveries, not in the front directly under the windows of the patrons paying a lot of money for the stay. It was very rude, and for that reason I would not recommend staying at this location.",avg

"When we checked in, I had booked a room with 2 queen beds. We got one king bed. There were 4 of us. They did fix the problem, however because of the big tournament going on they had a number of rooms blocked, not my problem as I still should have gotten the room I booked and paid for. The pool area was terrible. The worst pool area I have ever been in in a hotel. They only had buffet food in the restaurant due to the tournament which was also terrible especially for the price. It was nice to be right there where the tournament was so we had no travel time to and from. I think the best thing about the whole experience was the valet staff. They were very proficient, kind, and polite. The manager however, even fixing our room issue, had the vibe of being very irritated at having to fix our room issues. The girls at the counter were nice, the ice machines on all floors and in the restaurant ran out of ice and they were quick to make sure we had some. We probably wont be staying there again during a big tournament.",neg

"Ut fra det vi hadde lest om hotellet i beskrivelse og kundekommentarer ble vi meget skuffet. Det var langt fra noe juniorsuite, men en stor rom. Badet var ikke avfotografert og vi var derfor skeptiske, men uten grunn. Dette var ok.Det var beskrevet 2 svmmebasseng og barnebasseng (svmmebasseng var en forutsetning for oss da vi bestilte). Det var et basseng som ikke hadde/hadde anledning til solsenger og l delvis i skyggen pga trr/palmer. Fotoet fra hotellet viste feil. S godt som ingen gjester brukte det ene bassenget. Takterrassen var meget bra. Nr vei til en flott strand og et koselig sentrum. Det var ogs beskrevet at hotellet kunne hente bringe fra/til flyplassen (dette sjekket vi p mail til hotellet fr vi reiste). De kunne bestille taxi... Beskrevet gratis avis. Ja - i respesjonen. Klimanlegget var fast stilt p 19 gr.C. Ble ppekt 2 ganger fra oss uten bli ordnet. Samme tannglass - uten bli vasket - i 14 dager.. Det sparatet sitteomrdet var 2 stoler p rommet, ved sengen.. Kjleskapet p rommet var varmt. Vi fikk beskjed om at det skulle vre slik, men at vi mtte sette inn noe kaldt, s ville det bli bra. Det stemte ikke...Dessverre kommer vi ikke til reise tilbake.

"We were very disappointed with our stay. We made reservations for 2 stays during this trip. one night before our trip to Gatlinburg and one night on our return. we were disappointed both stays. We chose this hotel because of the location, the pool and the hot tub. The pool was so cold both nights (about a week apart) that we couldnt swim. There were other hotel guests also complaining, so it wasnt just us. The hot tub on the first night kept tripping a breaker. Which is a scary thing. The second night we had the attendent to see about getting the pool warmer, and to inform them the hot tub would not turn on and there were lots of bugs in it. She called the manager who stated that he just cleaned the pool and added water and it would take awhile to warm up. ( there were bugs and objects on the bottem of the pool). and that the hot tub was just checked and cleaned. Not Possible. We make several trips a year to Metropolis/ Paducah and have stayed here. If this is the way to please your guests we will be staying somewhere else from now on!!!",neg

My mom and I both felt like our necks were sore from the pillows after sleeping there. The hotel did have a breakfast that was fine. The hotel was right off the freeway and not much was right there, but we drove about 10 minutes and found a small historic area for dinner. Overall we would have rated the hotel higher if the staff had been friendlier and more customer service minded.

"This is a wonderful location, with some great perks but our stay was very disappointing. We actually stayed for a total of 6 nights as part of a belated honeymoon and rented the suite on the top floor with a balcony overlooking the grand canal. The hotel is lovely covered in very Venetian decor with lots of dark red velvet and glass chandeliers - just as you would hope. Unfortunately this only holds true for the first three floors, and the fourth floor is decorated out of the 1970s- mixed wood panels, weird chrome inlays, carpet with swirls and polk dots, and white space chairs- not what we were looking for in Venice. Our balcony was small but the view was absolutely lovely, but unfortunately the king bed was two twins pushed together with a sheet over them and they were incredibly hard- e.g. my arm was sore the next day because I slept on my side. I asked for a mattress pad or another comforter to sleep on and they only had two fleece blankets. Their toiletries were actually very nice- Gilchrist and Soames, but there was no shower curtain so if you showered in the american style everything gets soaked. Breakfast was lovely and elegant with hams, cheeses, salad, fruit, and cereal, as well as scrambled eggs and fresh bread (though it is 30 euros a person if it is not included- so be careful since it is just a buffet, no eggs cooked to order or anything like that). The staff for the most part were very friendly and their restaurant recommendations were good.",neg

As soon as I entered the room it had a noticeable bad smell - the smell wasn't unbearable - and was quite warmer than the lobby and outside temperature even with the AC in full force. The furniture was outdated and the room didn't have a microwave. I would not stay here if you are looking to be comfortable, however, for what I needed it was perfect: cheap, not far from the hwy, easy check in and out.

"terrible stay, countless problems: *reservation was made months in advance but needs were not met *showers in both rooms go from scalding to cold and back again impossible to set it on one temperature *outdoor trash bins were spilling onto the ground *room was not cleaned and the maid service showed up at 4 pm after we had returned to our rooms (after running a marathon!) so I phoned the office to say this was unacceptable. I spoke with the manager who clearly was not concerned about our comfort or satisfaction She said the hotel was busy and there were only 4 maids I was told they could clean until 5 pm and then they leave the room needed vacuuming and everything done but the weather was freezing and blustery so we could not stand outside while they clean and I told them to forget it. If check in is 3 pm I feel rooms should all be cleaned and ready by that time also....but the manager told me to go ahead and write a review online and hung up. *after outdoor trash was finally emptied on my third day there, feces was left on the ground near the bin right outside a guest room The bin had diapers in it and wind spilled everything everywhere.",neg

"Myself, husband, and two year old daughter booked 4 nights at the double tree. It was my first time in West Palm Beach. I was barely impressed with this hotel, being a large name brand, I expected more. The room was centrally located near the airport and highways which was great, thankfully we decided to rent a car because there was no scenery or activities to do near the hotel. The outside and lobby was pretty, very similar to other business hotels. I was extremely dissapointed upon check in when we realized the hotel pool was not only not in service, but it was completely empty. That was the only reason we booked this hotel was for the pool so again we had to drive to even swim on our family vacation. The room was mediocre, similar to a stay at our local hotels in the north east. The breakfast was over priced 15 per person for a breakfast buffet. Overall I would suggest not staying here while on vacation unless you are fully aware in order to do anything fun you must drive there. Also be sure to call before you check in to be sure the pool is in service. For the amount that was spend which was almost 150 per night I think we could have found a better place for our first family trip with our daughter. Good luck hope this helps.",avg

The maid did not speak English so it was hard to communicate with her, yet she did an outstanding job. The men who opened doors and did the valet parking were obnoxious.

I bought some wine and one of the men kept bugging me to give him a bottle of wine. These men would stand around and talk in their native tongue which I think is rude.

They were clearly overwhelmed. Not enough towels or pillows given this time for a room that obviously sleeps more than two - and no more at the desk. Not enough food to go around for the free breakfast - coffee was beyond terrible. The room felt very very damp the whole time.

And you don't want to because it is so hot that it is miserable to walk anywhere. You need a car. Also on the way to your hotel stop and get water. The water all over Bonita Springs is awful. Get bottles.",pos
"We asked the hotel staff about how to engage a water taxi to visit Murano. We were told simply that the hotel had its own taxi that departed every half hour and a return taxi would bring us back departing from Murano every half hour. We were pleased and were at the hotel's dock at 10:30 am sharp, where we were picked up by a water taxi. When we arrived at Murano, we were greeted by a gentlemen who led us into a glass factory. When inside, we watched a ten minute demonstration along with many other people who had not come on the taxi. After the demonstration we were lead into room with high end glass pieces and where we given a sales pitch that was reminiscent of a time share sales scheme. When we told them we were not interested, the sales person said to us: I am sure you can find your way back to the hotel on your own. Needless to say, we were not happy that our hotel misrepresented to us that their water taxi was not a water taxi provided by the hotel, but rather is funded by a high end glass factory and that herds tourists to its show room to push their high end glass pieces. This type of deception was really inappropriate, and we will never return to the Metropole.",neg

Very dirty room. The cleaning was not close to normal standards. To their credit I called the manager upstairs to show him and he did credit us one night back on our credit card.

I have to give this hotel a negative review. The reason why is they would not valet park my Mercedes Sprinter van. So I had to park at there overflow parking lot down the street. I have no problem with parking there UNTIL I find out they charged me 20.00 a day on top of my room cost. The manager said she could do nothing about the parking charges. And just a note they had oversized spots in the valet lot.,neg

Granted they appeared to be in the middle of an issue, but they could at least said hi and that they would be with me in a minute.

The views from the pool were beautiful but we had a Hillview room that looked directly onto the parking lot and not any hills. The staff was courteous but not friendly. We did order room service but it was basically a boxed lunch and for the price we paid we might as well have just gone to Starbucks and saved some money. I'd only recommend this hotel if you're planning on spending the whole day at the pool. But if you want to explore lakeway and Austin there are other options.,avg
it was a clean room. the air took awhile to cool down but once it did it was comfortable. the staff was wonderful and honest. we left a ring there and was about a half hour away and had to turn around to go back. the housekeeper gave it to us. she had found it. really wasn't expecting that. the only thing i didn't like was the temperature of the pool. the pool was hot. the room with the pool was hot. had to go outside after the swim to cool down. don't stay just because of the pool. stay because of the cleanliness and the good breakfast.,avg

Seemed like almost every room contained some sort of pet, lots of dog barking could be heard in hallway. Breakfast bar was disappointing. Hotel, in the name of healthy eating, put out an array of almost tasteless cheap foods.",pos
"For the great location, this hotel felt more Motel like. It's old and while they kept the hallway brimming with lavender happiness, the rooms smelled like a nursing home. On fire. My first room smelled like pure urine. Concentrated, hot and freshly brewed urine. After being moved, the second room smelled like the Great Georgian outdoors. While the night receptionist tried to help, there was no night housekeeping. So she sprayed and went back to work. I found out it was the heater and told them. They sprayed the filter, but to no avail. As they were sold out, I was stuck. Then the key cards kept malfunctioning. They weren't near my phone either. Going blank and reading red. I had to beat on the window at 2 am for three minutes to get in one night. Finally, although I booked and PAID thru a third party, the new girl at the desk at the time of my check-in charged my card over 200 in incidentals, rather than the required 60. That took 5 days to return to my account. Also no one made any documentation of anything, so when I complained to management and hotels.com, it was made to look as if none of this ever happened or was reported. NEVER, NEVER stay here. There's another Fairfield up the street that, at least, looks a million times better. Please, take heed and don't chance it. Oh, but they did have some nice beds. My stay was a country song. The saddest, broken down pickup, lost my job, won't stop raining, she left with everything but the dog country song ever.",neg

Even worse, when I went to take a shower, there was a used piece of soap in there. Finally, there was no bathmat--combined with a slippery floor, that could have easily been a lawsuit waiting to happen. The rate was average for a place of this type, but I've stayed at other places that cost this little and the bathrooms were pleasingly stocked. Sorry--can't recommend this one.",neg

The hotel is very clean but the room was a bite smelly. They need to put in air fresher or something for the place to have a better smell.

"Was a Ramada Inn in 1972. Obviously has not been renovated (or keep up) since - except the obnoxious color outside. Pool is closed and locked gates to poolside lounge chairs. Amenities listed on site are not factual. Continental breakfast is a joke. I could go on, but not worth my time. Spent 3 nights there and slept very little - noise and overall unsafe feeling. Would not recommend this motel nor would I stay there again. 49.00 may sound reasonable, but the original Ramada Inn price of 12.50 in 1972 is about the going rate for this hot spot....keep looking or sleep in your car.",pos

Bathrooms well appointed modern and clean. Despite being near the airport and major roads, the rooms were very quiet. Easy access from I-84 and I-87. This hotel has been underrated. Perhaps most pf the ratings preceded the renovation. NOTE: For handicap accessibility,request a first floor room. No elevator, but first floor corridor is accessible from the lobby, no steps.

I went out of my room and the hall was smokey.  I reported this to the front desk, and they investigated it, but told me there was nothing they could do since they couldn't tell which room it was coming from.  I had to stuff a towel under my door to try and keep the smell out, and it would have been nice if they would have atleast did something to vent the air in the hallway.

Hotel employees very helpful in giving directions on the best places to visit and see in Venice. You are able to by a bus pass at the hotel to get to the island since you are on the mainland.

Even though it was marked off it clearly has been an issue for some time due to waterstains around the ice maker. Finally got into room & noticed stained carpet & lack of lighting (one light bulb out & no lights in back area of room). The table & chairs appeared they were from a garage sale. We were so tired after traveling all day that we just wanted to lay down. My wife had to go to the restroom & saw a cockaroach in the sink when she turned on the bathroom light. She did not tell me till the next morning (I had already fallen asleep). So after I woke up, I had to go to the restroom & turned on the light upon entering noticed a couple of cockaroaches around the sink area. After discussing our plans for the day we wanted to shower & get ready for the day but lo & behold no bath towels. I go to Front Desk & informed that there are NO BATH TOWELS UNTIL 10AM WHEN HOUSEKEEPING ARRIVES. I was like are you serious? Front Desk apologized for the inconvenience but there was no offer to reduce cost of room nor provide credit in any way.

"We stayed at this hotel recently when we had a family emergency. Overall if you are just looking for a place to sleep it is not that bad. However, if you are expecting anything else, this place is lacking. When we arrived there was no one at the desk. After we stood there for a couple of minutes someone shouted out that they would be there in a minute. The staff was not rude but I would say they were indifferent. We went up to our room and my brother and his family went to his. Our room was ok however, my brother had to immediately return to the desk and have his room switched. When he entered the original room the beds were not on their frames and it looked like the furniture was being moved around. His new room had no towels. The front desk informed us that they were out of towels. The pool water was a freezing but the room was 100 degrees. There were no towels at the pool either. We were told that hopefully there would be towels in the morning. The shower squealed when it was on and went from extremely hot to freezing. This was tons of fun with children who were trying to shower. The carpet in the hall and the main stair case was never vacuumed and disgusting. I know they never vacuumed it because we were there for 2 nights and it never got cleaned. As other reviews have stated breakfast was nothing to brag about. I would NEVER stay at this hotel again. For an extra couple of we could have stayed at the Econo Lodge right next door. It is a much nicer hotel.",neg

"We stayed at the Monaco from 7/5/11 - 7/7/11 and were really pleased. I have stayed at many 5 star hotels and had not-so-great experiences ... this one was a breath of fresh air.From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, everyone was always smiling, pleasant and very helpful. We were checked in very quickly and our room (two double beds) was big, very clean and smelled nice. The bathroom was so sparkling clean that my son (who is very picky) couldn't wait to take a bath (FYI, we are generally shower people.) Yes, the a/c unit can be loud, but when you're tired from a day of sightseeing and full from a big dinner ... all I can say is that I slept very well. I personally would have preferred a firmer mattress but that is really the only complaint I can make. When I realized that I had left my toothbrush and showercap at home, I called the front desk and housekeeping was at my door in 5 minutes with complimentary toiletries. As for Wi-Fi, just sign up on their website to join their club (no charge) and you will get your internet for free. I even read that you can get coupons for some free mini-bar use.My brother and his wife were on the trip with us and their room, with a king bed, was smaller than ours. Being from Europe, they are not fans of a/c to begin with and the loud noise theirs was making made it hard for them to sleep. They finally called guest services to complain because they couldn't turn if off either and were immediately moved to another room (just to sleep in) for the night. The next day while we were out, they had an engineer come in and fix the unit. By the time we came back, it was working fine and there was a bottle of wine waiting for them for their troubles.I did like the decor of the lobby ... colorful and eclectic but in a nice way. The location itself was great because it was so close to great shops and restaurants. There is a french cafe next door which was great for breakfast. We tried dinner at the restaurant downstairs ... although my dinner was good (bucket of fried chicken), my brother felt that the ribs and BBQ chicken were a bit dry. Overall, not worth the money we spent. The wait staff, however, was very efficient and friendly.The next night we tried an Italian restaurant up the street ... Bartucci's. This place was great! Their pastas were homemade and the seafood was fresh and cooked perfectly. Great wine selection also. This place was worth it and we will definitely go back next time we are in town.Overall, I found our stay very satisfying and reasonably priced. Checkout was quick and they even e-mailed me my bill. Based on my experience, I would definitely go back and I would recommend this place without hesitation!",pos

Old standard round toilet with a very loose seat. The windows had not been cleaned in a long time. Air leaks around the sliding glass door, which I did not dare try and open.

We had our ceremony in the Historic Ballroom on the first floor, then guests moved up to Scandals on the second floor for the cocktail hour and then the reception was on the seventh floor terrace with a view of the whole city!

The views on the road driving toward the property is also spread with vine trees. The service and cleanness is no doubt a good quality. However, the proper is more like rectangle shape so depending on where your room is located and if you are parking near it with limited parking space outside or at the big parking lot. It's quite a long walk. Our room is overlook at the golf course so the view is fantastic. It's very close to Chateau Margaux if you are a wine lover!",pos

But, John took care of us and in the end we were very happy with our choice of venue. Our guests loved the location of the hotel and all that the neighborhood had to offer. The Glassdoor restaurant was very accommodating to my large family, and everyone was happy with their rooms.We didn't use a wedding coordinator, and the hotel was very accommodation about giving us ample time to set up, and Les was a big help in the set up process. The space is very customizable to colors/styles and can accommodate a large crowd easily.The food came out amazing, and our guests raved about it all. The chef took care of us, and even did a second tasting with us to ensure we got exactly what we wanted.The weather was amazing, and being able to have an outdoor wedding in January was a treat. Overall, we loved our wedding and are happy with our choice. We felt it was a great value, particularly for the San Diego area.",pos

"For this establishment to give the name of FIesta Inn and Suites is a bad form of advertisement. The ONLY association they have with the Theme park is that it is not that far from there... Also in my opinion any 4-5 star reviews this hotel gets I believe were posted by staff/owner! Two words for this place is Gross! Gross! This hotel well if what we had was a suite then....I just don't have words because 2 weeks later and I am still stunned and finding it hard to believe I stayed there 1 night. Breakfast made me ill to my stomach. I did not feel like I was in clean hotel when it came to the room. The appliances in suite were from 1960 and fridge was leaking water from icebox. Stove was well not sure what it aspired to be but i would not cook anything on it or in it. Plugs did not work through out and no AC in room...it is is living area so to get this AC air you have to sleep with door open. The bathrooms although for most part clean the tub was dingy, the sheets appear decades old (along with lumpy mattresses, flat pillows and decore from the 60's). This establishment is great for a budget minded person but I predict foul practices from not so savory citizens happen here (as evidenced by our room door having been kicked in on numerous occassions-it was hard to open and when you did get it open the door at bottom where frame and door meet was split). I was this close to sleeping in my car with my family instead. Never will I stay here again. Nice staff but not nice hotel!",neg
The team at the hotel took care of us like they had known us for years.  The customer service could not had been better.  A very pet friendly hotel.  Morning coffee and afternoon wine in the lobby was nice each day.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the Alexandria area.,pos

"We booked a standard King, non-smoking room. When we got there, they gave us a smoking room that smelled and looked horrible. When I asked if we could move to a non-smoking room, like we had booked, they said that the room was a non-smoking room (then why was there an ashtray on the sink) and that someone must have broken the rules and smoked in the room previously. They said they were completely booked and could not move us. We had to keep the window open during our entire stay (low of 25 degrees one night) just so we could breathe. There were stains all over the walls from where people had been smoking in that room for a long time. There were also body hairs in the shower when we got there. Not just one or two, but multiple hairs all over the tub. When we went down for breakfast Sunday morning at 7am, both trash cans were completely full and people had begun leaving their trash on the tables. We never saw an employee while we were down there. I have stayed with LaQuinta multiple times before and have never had an issue. I will definitely never stay at this location again after this terrible experience.",neg
The elevators were old and rickety and broke down Saturday morning. The steps were dark and smelled of stale cigarettes. There were homeless people.crashing in the lobby. It looks like Richmond houses people there. The parking garage was dark and obstructed from view if hotel. The iron steps in garage are old and rusty and wobbly. The hotel is being renovated . it has an outdated appearance and cheap fixes. For the price it's okay.it's in a rough neighborhood-inner-city Richmond. The breakfast was good and the ladies were really nice who did the breakfast.,avg
The hotel was easy to get to and pretty quiet for being just off the freeway. Pretty central to everything I wanted to do. Room was comfortable and had probably the best showerhead and water pressure I have experienced in any hotel. Would recommend for that alone,pos

"This hotel is a wonderful place to stay, provided you aren't there on a weekend where it is filled to capacity due to some festival/marathon in one of the local towns. With so many guests present, they didn't have enough bandwith for everyone to have WiFi. My wife and I never could log on to the WiFi because it always said there were too many users accessing the system. The other downside to so many guests is that there was hardly any water pressure while taking a shower. If you do end up being there on a festival/marathon weekend, you might try showering really early in the morning or really late at night if you want more than a limp trickle out of your shower head. This really is a good hotel and despite the minor inconvienences we will definitely consider returning sometime, provided it isn't around a festival or marathon weekend.",pos

I gave it the benefit of a doubt that it was cleaner inside, since one should never judge a book by its cover, however when I open the door, I was meet by the moldy odor of the room.

He refused to refund our money or give us a new room, so we left and stayed at the Marriot next door. We called back later to again try and get a refund and he hung up on us. The staff is very unprofessional here, PLEASE don't waste your money. The cleaning staff was just hanging out in the food area (while they should have been cleaning our room!!) and the man who worked at the front desk had his family just hanging out in the lobby. Everything would have been find if we had a. Been given a new room, b. Gotten a refund, or c. Had the cleaning staff re-clean our room. None of which happened. I'll never be staying at a Microtel again after this.",neg

"I stayed in the BB in Cambridge from 9-14 August 2014 when I attended a course at Harvard. The biggest asset of this BB is the location: it is 10-min. walk to the Harvard Yard. The breakfast was also very good (crepes or flapjacks with blueberries), but could be more varied. Byron, the live-in manager was very helpful and entertaining. I booked this BB based on the very positive reviews, but the standard has obviously dropped since they were written. Having said that, the owners have been working on bringing it back to standard, especially the cleanliness. However, more work is needed to make it a competitive BB, suitable to the needs of business travellers or visitors to Harvard or MIT. It was also too expensive for what it offered (188 a night!) The bathroom is shared! If you are on a tight schedule you will need to book the shower. We had 5 people competing for the shower, but the biggest problem was the toilet (no guest WC). The back porch needs a lot of work before it can be enjoyed by the guests, but they do have a selection of books and Byron is a walking encyclopaedia of knowledge about Cambridge and Boston. Parking: you will need a lot of luck or a lot of patience! The apartment is on the third floor, so ask Byron for help with your luggage. Bottom line: Great location, and great potential. With honest work this can be a great place to stay for visitors to Harvard or MIT. I hope the owners will turn this BB around to deserve great reviews again.",neg

The problem with the hotel is the noise coming from the street. At night a guy sets up a music box on the street and attempts to sing along. The music was horrible and the sound carried into the room as if he was sitting next to me. Despite my complaining, it went on till well after 11 p.m. I was not able to sleep, read or think due to the sound. I know it is not exactly the hotel's fault, but I would of appreciated being given some information about how loud the room was going to be during the evening.

My husband and I had a dark basement room with exposed pipes in the hallway and a view of the kiddy pool.

"The Gardena Terrace Inn was just a one night stay for us. At first glance the front desk is nice and remodeled and the person working was super nice. Going to the room, the elevator certificate was out of date and so was the ambiance. There is courtyard area in the middle of the hotel to sit which was nice. Inside the room it was large and all counter tops/tables remodeled with the same quartz as the front desk but inside the room was brown. The bathroom was also remodeled with body wash, shampoo, and conditioner dispensers on the inside of the wall but for our room, the body wash was completely drained and there were no bars of soap. There was one, clearly used bottle of body lotion by the sink but I feel soap is more important than lotion. We got in late and left early. This inn got the job done and that's about it. Kudos to the workers for being so kind and I'm sure the amenities would have been refilled if we had asked.",avg

We really never even felt part of the hotel. We had to walk outside of a locked alley and our room unlocked straight off the street (Kerlerec Street). This room matches none of the pictures advertised on their website. There is not one piece of art on the wall. There was a mirror at one time but it is now leaning against the wall and a hole is displayed where it once hang. The bed was comfortable and the shower was nice. Location was within walking distance to all we wanted to do, but you cannot sleep. Like I said we were right off the street and you can hear every person walking by, at 1am, 2am, 3am...it quieted down by 4am.

But this hotel is completely isolated from everything, and just crossing the highway to get to the Big malls across the street is a big hassle. You're better off staying at the Grand Hyatt or Kempenski, which have direct mall access.

While it was a 15 minute drive to our destination, we chose this hotel because we have stayed here before and had great service. As expected, we were not disappointed. We highly recommend this hotel. Every staff member we encountered was very nice,",pos
"not bad, however , we were without cable tv and internet for around a whole day when everything was shut and nothing to do, yes the country was under a natural disaster, but as guests of the hotel we had no other source of entertainment or means of communication with the outside world.... it should have been made top priorty when it occured",neg
Our experience at villa carolotta went beyond our expectations. From the moment we arrived the staff was super friendly. Upon our arrival in the morning they immediately took us to the terrace for a magnificent buffet breakfast. We felt that there 5 star service made us feel at home. They made us fresh cannoli from their kitchen. We look forward to coming back to visit. Grazie Mille,pos

"The Days Inn at Kuttawa, KY was a clean, attractive facility. The room was spacious and well-maintained. The breakfast bar was included in the cost of the room and had a variety of choices.

The pillows weren't comfortable. A regular type dining chair was in the room. Scuffed up walls. At 1:52 am in the morning someone near to us kept banging on the door louder and louder. In another room a lady was yelling. Then in another room they kept going in and out letting the door slam shut over and over. This went on for quit awhile (30 minutes plus).

The room was a bit dark and the bed not very comfortable (old mattress smaller than the frame) but I had view on the nice garden, which is what I was looking for. The breakfast was nice and you can ask the staff a real coffee (the one at the machine is not very nice). The staff was very nice and helpful, speaking English and French as well.",pos
"From the outside I was a little leery of what the room would be like, but it was very clean and quite nice. The heater (I was there in February) was noisy so I felt like the TV was loud to compensate for it, but there isn't really anything that the owners could do about that. The room was a nice size, there were two drawers missing from the dresser where the tv sat, but since I didn't need them it was of no concern. There was a small refrigerator and microwave in the room also.",neg

This hotel is undergoing construction. Banging and other loud noises begin early in the morning.

"We enjoyed the hotel its self, close to good restaurants. Good transportation to Disneyland for a small fee. There was a couple of things that were not as pleasant. The toilet ran on and on but they fixed that. Housekeeping didn't clean our room one day. We were going to eat in their restaurant but didn't get any service and ordered room service one morning but it wasn't good at all and very expensive. Other than that the suite was nice, we all slept good and enjoyed the room. I would recommend this hotel, just don't eat there.",pos
Hotel is very clean and staff are friendly and attentive.,pos
Halls reeked of marijuana. Pool was overpacked with non guests from a birthday party rental. They offer memberships to the pool and exercise room to non guests. Pool was not very clean. Was given 2 towels and wash clothes for 4 people in a room. Website stated free breakfast but neglected to say it was for 2 and you pay tax and gratuity for the free ones also. Website and book in room said there are snack vending machines and there are only ice and soda vending machines. Shower was luke warm and no way to make it warmer. Worst hotel I have ever stayed in.,neg

I was told downtown had decent places to eat and found none, just fast food stores, closed up businesses and many people hanging out on streets asking for money. If you stay here make sure you eat before checking in or have someone who knows the area take you out to eat. The hotel was fine I had no issues with it, don't misunderstand me, the location of it was an issue.",avg

"This is a distressed property whose employees lack a basic comprehension of the following words: Inn, Traveler, Courtesy Customer Service: Check-in was not allowed until 3pm. No exceptions! No restroom for guests not allowed to check in. The teenager at the front desk didn't offer an alternative for me to relive myself. Subsequently, I learned there was a Denny's across the street and a Chevron across the parking lot with available restrooms. Booking: I booked two beds. Only a single king bed was available. This did not bode well with the gentleman in my motorcycle club with whom I split the room. (We are both heterosexuals and had no interest in sharing a bed). Room Condition: 213 In spite of the decree on the lobby, ALL ROOMS ARE NON SMOKING, my room wreaked of stale cigarette smoke. The single bath towel (on day of check in and after room service the next day) was inconveniently located on the shelf under the sink and difficult to reach from the shower (in the next room.) Two of the lamps didn't initially operate. I discovered one wasn't plugged in. The other was plugged into an outlet that was so loose I had to lean something against the cord so it would work. The toilet had a leaky flapper valve that caused the tank to refill and adversely affected the continuity of my sleep. Overall: I think the two star rating was an overstatement",neg

For 225 a night and free parking (which costs at least 50 a day at hotels like Westin St Francis), we had a really comfortable stay. Marina neighborhood is great for walking. We had street noise outside our window on the 2nd floor, with car alarms and traffic, but our friends staying across the hall and facing a different street reported that their room was quiet.",pos

"Hotel is weiil located on King .St. where a free trolley operates most of the day. Very good restaurants, especially Le Madeleine, close by and the waterfront is within easy walking distance. Trolley run to the King St. Metro which connects to the DC and surrounding area. There is a courtesy van that will pickup and take you to the Reagan Airport (DCA) which was not advertised. Use it. We will stay there again.",pos
"This hotel is aging a bit but its still nice. Its two floors (no elevator) and its a bit incognito as there really isn't a sign to let you know its a Holiday Inn. The nice new big Holiday Inn Express with the glowing sign is next door, this is not that hotel. Although aging and in need of a room refresh, the lobby and common areas are nice and the front desk staff was friendly and very helpful with a late check out. There is a great Italian Restaurant in the lobby that in 3 meals never disappointed and there is also a large bar. It was weird having a room with a window that looked into the indoor common pool/game area so no natural light and for some unknown reason, someone was vacuuming the carpet in that area at 7am one morning. Not a pleasant wake up call. All in all though it was pretty decent and i would stay again.",pos
"We had the room facing the street, and above the lobby at the top of the stairs. It was noisy, and our room smelled like it had not been used in many years, and like smoke. Twice during the night someone was using their card to try to get in to our room. The one guy said that he had been using the same room for a long time and then we resorted to telling him we were calling the police. Then he left us alone. The continental breakfast was a danish and an apple..I would not stay here again.",neg
"We were thrilled with everything from the cleanliness to the top notch breakfast to the kindness of everyone but, the very first person we met. She was the first person we approached behind the counter when we arrived. Later we learned that she was handling both the desk and the Housekeeping roles that night. If I were to judge the facility by this one person, I would have been disappointed in her lack of hospitality in answering our questions: no smile, no patience...cranky. However the rest of our stay, and we did add an extra night, more than made up for it. This was my first getaway in 4 years on ANY kind of vacation/family celebration, so I was really hoping for a good time. I really enjoyed the cleanliness, as I own a cleaning service here in MD. Thank you so much for an overall excellent stay!!!",pos

The rooms were very comfortable. They had good pillows and the beds were just the right amount of firmness vs. softness. The location was perfect and near to a lot of restaurants and shops. The lady at the front desk was not a local person because she had a hard time giving directions but she was still very sweet and helpful. I think this was one of the best places we have stayed at for such a cheap price. Would definitely stay there again next year for another UO hosted tournament.,pos
"A basic hotel. Nothing fancy, but sufficient for our needs.",avg
"3 of us (adults),arrived at 2pm and were dropped off by our transfer just outside the apartment area as there is no vehicle access to the apartment and reception areas ( very safe for children). This meant we had to carry our own luggage down to the reception area which was not easy initially to find as it is not well signposted. However, having found the reception, the staff where very efficient and pleasant. Once we had our apartment details we then had to transfer our own luggage to the apartment block, where there was a lift to the 1st floor where our apartment was. All the apartments are in many individual blocks only three floors high, spread about the area. Once in the apartment we were very pleased with the clean condition of the 1 bed apartment and the two sofas in the lounge area simply required the back cushions removed to reveal a large single bed. We had a decent sized balcony with a sea and pool view to the side of the apartment so not directly over the pool, which in the end was actually better as it was quieter. We had a couple of minor issues which when we called reception on the apartment's internal phone, where resolved immediately with a response from staff to the apartment within 5 mins, EXCELLENT SERVICE!.",pos
"Room was actually very clean except for the bed. Just under one pillow was a toe nail clipping and a curly hair. If not for that it was very clean. The shower head felt like a car wash, very uncomfortable shower. The fridge and microwave didn't work. Overall not too bad though if you just need a place to sleep like us. Priced about right I think.",avg

Staff was rude and didn't speak English very well so maybe that's the communication barrier. Motel under construction so very messy. They did have apology signs up. Parking lot very small then they offer 5/day parking if your traveling. Doesn't leave much room for others staying. Airport shuttle is mini van but did the trick just fine. Ride to airport only 5 minutes max. Overpriced for what you get overall.,neg

Our room had visible water damage on ceilings although not actively a problem. The shower had an awkward showerhead and the tub drained very slowly. The refrigerator was nice to have, but it kept everything slightly slushy to frozen with no obvious way to turn down, we had to unplug it at one point.

The room was at first floor, we had trouble to fall in sleep because of the noises from the upstairs. If we knew it, we would request for the upper room. Beside that, everything was ok. I personally liked the free self service breakfast there. I could make some fresh waffles for my family served with hot tea or coffee. Staying there, we could have the permit to buy tickets at Incline Private beach. 12 per adult, free for kid under 6 years old.",pos

"I do not like to give negative reviews but sometimes It is best to be honest so that improvements can be made and so that others who are considering making a reservation, know what to expect when they check in their room. My first complaint was the price for what was given. I am sure that because of the high demand in this market, prices are based on supply and demand. Having said this, I was prepared to pay a higher price for the two nights we stayed. However, there is no excuse for a room that had dead bugs on the window sills and hair in the bathtub. These were not cleaned out between the two days of our stay. After seeing the dead bugs in the bathroom window, i found evidence of more dead bugs in the room. With this, I felt like the room was not being cleaned properly and only made us doubt the cleanliness of the room for the remainder of our stay. Also, I found a large bite on my right arm after the first night. I am almost certain this happened in the room on our first night. The TV was an older type of TV, not the more modern version flat screen. That was not a particular problem as much as that the TV did not even work. We were told that the remote was probably the problem so they traded it out for a new one and that also did not work. So for two nights we had no TV. Again, I was prepared to pay the higher cost but in this case felt like I was taken advantage of. There is no excuse for this kind of customer treatment.",neg
"If you need a bathroom and bed, it's a fine place to stay. And it's about the only place in miles. Sam at the desk was congenial. Many rooms face the highway so if you are bothered by traffic noise, request a room in the back. The toilets are very low. Rooms are cleaned with a fragrance-scented something so if you are smell-sensitive, that might be an issue. Room had a fridge and microwave, which was handy for the leftover Godfather's Pizza from next door. There were a variety of pillow softnesses. One matresses was extremely soft, the other a nice firmness. Could use more hooks and a hanidcap bar in the shower/bathroom.",avg

"Staff were unhelpful except for room cleaners who couldn't have been nicer. Rooms OK, cleaned daily. Outside areas nice, close to the beach but not really good location for walking around with small children. Breakfast very limited, muesli only on 3 of the 10 days we stayed and you are not allowed to take your own food or drink into the hotel or grounds. People were smoking in the dining room at breakfast time, and staff took no notice when complaints were made. Receipts were not given at poolside for any drinks etc. which were charged to our room so you had to keep a tally of what had been ordered. This was our 8th time in Bali, and we thought we would try somewhere different but won't do that again. On the whole, as cheap hotels go it wasn't too bad but we would not go back there again. We prefer to pay a little more and have much better facilities, friendlier staff etc.",avg

"I stayed at the hotel for two nights while taking an exam in Phoenix. During my time there, I was either taking the exam or in the hotel room. I did not go to any place else. I had two beds in my bedroom, so one night I slept in one bed, and in the second night I slept on the second bed. During the second night, I woke up with a few bites in my leg, and it was itching a lot. I ignored, but moments later there were more bites. I changed beds because I needed to get more sleep for my exam, and could not go through something in the middle of the night to change rooms. I told the staff, and all I got was I'm sorry. That was it. The manager did not contacted me, nor was there a concern about my bites and how I was doing. I threw away my clothes that were in that bedroom, and I'm never coming back there. I spent over 100 dollars each night, for one night wake up itching everywhere. The reason why I didn't book a cheap hotel, at the end, didn't make much difference for me.",neg

Additionally, at 5 o'clock in the morning, someone in a nearby room had set the alarm clock but failed to turn it off and so for a half an hour we heard nothing but very loud buzzing which unfortunately, woke us up.

The outside door wouldn't close all the way so security was a joke. Curtains were ripped and sagging, sofa ripped and extremely old. The whole exterior of the building was deteriorating, chipped, peeling, warped, etc. The ad online stated it was next to convention center. What center That was out of business. The whole place should be destroyed. I will never stay at another Guest House and not recommend it to anyone.",neg
The hotel was looking a little tired in places. The Lobby had patched sections of wall - not finished. Our room was right next to the pool and the area out in the hall smelled strongly of pool chemicals. But the room was odor free. The well appointed bath - which looked to be very recently renovated - was beautiful. But the fan was tied into the one switch for the lights in the bathroom. The fan sounded like a jet taking off. There were no other options for using the lights in the bathroom. We went to a store and bought ourselves a couple of plug in lights to light the bathroom for us so we could use it without the deafening noise. Other than that - our stay was as expected.,pos

This was the most horrible hotel I have ever stayed in. First of all the man at the front desk was extremely rude to me and my friend. Once we got our room we heard someone outside our door about an hour later I looked the peep hole and the man from the front desk was looking inside our peep hole!! I was so freaked out I kept checking it all night I was even too scared to leave through the front door the next day. I originally planned to stay 2 nights but was so disgusted that I booked a different hotel the next night! Do not stay there especially if you're a young female!,neg

From going to view The Abbey, booking the room, the tasting, all of the planning along the way, and on the big day. Tabby was a pleasure to work with, she is the best! Tabby was very helpful and answered any questions that we had while planning our wedding. She was very quick to respond to emails and phone calls. Tabby made sure all of our requests were met. She made sure that our room was set up exactly how we wanted and that everything ran smoothly on our wedding day. Both my husband and I could not have imagined working with anyone else. She really made our special day even more magical than we could have hoped for.We had our reception in the Harbor Ballroom. The room looked amazing and was very spacious. The windows overlooking the harbor set up a breathtaking view. Our guests were blown away. The food was also top notch. All of our guests were raving about all courses of their meals. The bartenders and waitstaff were very friendly as well. We also booked a block of rooms for our wedding. The rooms looked great, were very clean, and comfortable. The Abbey would be a perfect venue to have a wedding for any couple.",pos
A decent hotel for the pocket conscious..my room was on the first floor near elevator. Heard everyone getting in n out. The bathroom was basic no frills..had to hold the toilet handle in order for it to flush properly. Toilet n shower set apart from bathroom sink...didnt like that. In order to get ice you have to go to the 3rd floor it... Breakfast was nice...they need more than one waffle maker. Staff not very friendly either.,avg

"The hotel seemed awesome with lots to do and amenities . It seemed well kept and modern ... that is until one steps off of the elevator on the floor. Worn carpet meets scuffed walls and its clear this place had seen better days in the early 2000s .the room was appointed like an innner city loft except it was the size of the average postage stamp . Walls were thin ... concersations from other rooms were plainly audible in our room and in the hall . Fast forward to the next morning ... my wife had just had surgery . She was mortally embarassed when the slow and surly front desk clerk informed us our 25 security deposit was forfeit because of stains on the sheets . A wash and wear item. The arrogant clerk refused to rescend her stance even after the situation was explained . Instead she only became more surly and snippy . For the price this seemed a fine place , and if it wasnt for the people and the polices it would have been. But after they revoked our deposit for reasons not defined in their nonexistant written policy we could have stayed at a holiday inn express.",avg

Unfortunately we were disappointed by uncleanliness and lack of housekeeping. Our room had garbage in it, urine in the toilet, and dirty towels when we got there. We also asked for housekeeping but in the two nights we were there no one ever came in to our room. Disappointing!",avg

Condo had a washer and dryer in it which was a pleasant surprise as most places don't have that. Kitchen was stocked with all the stuff needed to cook, all you need to buy is whatever you want to prepare to eat. Room was nice and had an ocean view. Another great thing about this condo was the location, you are able to walk a few minutes and be right in the middle of shops and food.",pos

Location was conveniently located right behind the Mall of America, within a mile of the airport and we felt the price for a family was very affordable. My only recommendation would be to give the breakfast server some assistance when the hotel is booked solid. The food bar and plates during breakfast were continually out of stock the entire morning of our stay. (The waffle machine never was refilled while we were there.) One person just can't handle all this, but I will give her a B for her effort and attitude.",pos

I originally booked 2 queens and received a call the day before to see if we were willing to switch to a King size bed with a comfortable pull out queen bed on the house. She kept emphasizing that the room is slightly larger since we have 2 adults and 1 child. So we agreed. WORST DECISION EVER. The queen pull out was not only lumpy and slanted, but even our 3 year old said she was NOT sleeping on it! Obviously they've never slept on their own pull out because if they did, then it would've been thrown again 10 years ago!",neg

"HORRIBLE! Our room smelled like urine the second we walked in. My daughter later noticed 2 men's razors in the shower along with hair and a chunk of soap bar in the drain. Obviously, the bathroom (and the rest of the room) was never cleaned from the previous visitors, which in a small town, could have been the previous weekend ( They started putting all the breakfast items away 15 min before closing.

I almost ended in the room next to me. At least the hotel staff was helpful. In the future I much rather sleep in my car than in this place. Quality Inn should be ashamed of these facilities and Hotels.com should check out hotels before they list them to ensure they are at least somewhat in decent condition.

The hotel had been completely renovated to modern and sleek rooms. The hotel was still under construction at the pool however this didn't impact our stay too much. Hotel is quiet and more grated towards business or a place to sleep versus somewhere to spend slot of time.

I had a wood grill pizza, and I loved it and would definately order one again. The atmosphere is very classy casual, but yet they treat you like you're in an upscale fancy restaurant. Prices are quite fair, they're set at a good inbetween range not too expensive and not too cheap. I think this place is especially great for business lunches when you're looking for a nice place to entertain a client, but don't want anything too upscale and foo foo. Lobby has a clean atmosphere, good service, tasty food, and everything is just very classy and sophisticated. I really enjoyed.",avg

"Beware: Before we realized what was happening, the hotel staff had hand-written our credit card number on a list. As someone who works in customer service, I questioned the staff about this.

They said it would be stored for three years behind the desk. Needless to say, I have frozen that card and will be replacing it.

"The room itself was nice, but the service was disappointing. We arrived about 1045pm after a full day car ride and were told by the lady at the front desk that she was doing her night audit and we could not check in until 11pm when the next worker arrived. We sat around and waited until 11 (when all we wanted to do was go to bed) and when the next worker arrived she proceeded to complain about all the work she had to do with all the check-ins that night (we were in the area for an event so I guess they were more full than usual). We were finally able to check in close to half an hour after we originally arrived. The room itself was nice, but one of the reasons we chose the extended stay was for the kitchenette. The kitchenette was nice and clean, but there was nothing stocked in it. On the website, it appeared there would be at least some basic stuff in the unit, but everything (including a coffee pot which most rooms include even without a kitchenette) had to be ordered from the front desk and at that point we didn't want to deal with the front desk staff again. When we checked out in the morning, we had to wait again at the front desk because the 2 workers were talking in the back and did not acknowledge us until we had been waiting for close to 5 minutes and finally had to ask them to let us check out. It could have been a much worse experience, but I doubt we will go back again because of the poor service.",avg

"Awful, awful, awful!!! On our trip from FL to VT we had stayed at a Hampton the previous night and it was just exceptional, so we sought out another Hampton Inn along our trip. We were traveling with our 2 non-shedding very well behaved medium sized dogs and were told at check in that there would be a 75 pet fee per dog! There was no indication of this online at all. The check in clerk stated that they were having problems with dogs so just changed their policy to charge a fee, and she was nice enough to only charge us for one pet - 75.00. Are you kidding We were then put in one of the pet rooms which shared a wall with the elevator and that's exactly what we heard the entire night, the elevator going up and down. We asked to be moved but was told there are only so many pet friendly rooms and there were no other rooms available. Pet friendly You must mean pet tolerant since in no way was this hotel pet friendly. On top of that I could not get the room to cool off and the air conditioner made a horrible noise the entire night. What a change from the Hampton Inn in Columbia, SC that we stayed the night before, a real gem! I would never stay at this hotel again.",pos

If they are not that confident in their room, you should not be either. We walked to the room, opened the door, took 2 steps in, and left. The smell, appearance, and condition of the room, made us turn away. I could not leave the room comfort blank, but we wound up not staying.",neg

There are no directions for proper use/settings for the coffee maker. The room had places that were not clean. There was dust on the refrigerator, lamps and tables. The top of the refrigerator was disgusting with food stains and looked like it had never ever been cleaned. The breakfast on the holiday, Monday, September 5, was very poor. Even as early as 8 am, the food had run out and they could never keep up after that so when we went back to check again, for example, the eggs tray was empty.

"Where do I even begin with all the wonderful things to say about this place. We had our wedding here and planned the entire thing from New York - now this would not have happened if it wasn't for Julie Stanfield. She is amazing and that is a true understatement! She took care of every little detail and allowed me to not stress one bit the day of the wedding. The venue is BEAUTIFUL. All of the out-of-state guests loved it, saying it was the most peaceful place with the nicest staff they have ever met. Everything from the rooms to the staff to the food was impeccable. As far as the wedding and reception - it was literally perfect (we even extended an hour). Nothing, nothing at all, went wrong that I am aware of. And if something did, Julie is so good she would have taken care of it without my knowing. She took care of all the little details that a bride forgets about, like putting purses and cell phones in a safe spot, holding my flowers on cue when needed, taking gifts back to our room, along with setting up rose petals and champagne on our bed without us knowing! She is on the ball 24/7 with planning and was always reachable, even on her days off. We HIGHLY recommend using Lakeway for your wedding, if not just a vacation! The staff is nothing short of amazing :)",pos

"The picture on the website where I found this hotel was NOT the one we stayed in. It did not show that it was an outside entrance, or I would not have chosen this hotel. The room was not very clean and neither was the pool. Also, all three of my family members who stayed at this hotel found spiders and other bugs in their rooms, as did I, in the coffee maker. My only consolation was that the price of the room was much cheaper upon check out than when I booked it. That made this disappointing stay a bit easier to swallow, but I will not be back to stay at this hotel in the future.",neg

"We found this hotel while travelling and had read a few bad reviews due to it being renovated!!! We had time to go echeck it out before actually booking!! We asked to see a room and were very pleasantly surprises by how lovely and new the hotel and room was!! They. Have done a great job of the Reno!! The hallways, rooms and main areas are clean plus and very tastefully decorated!! The room had great beds and high end quality linens. The room was large and spacious!! We stayed at the hotel for dinner as there was a bar/restaurant on the premesis!! Super friendly staff and the food was of very good quality for pub food!! Nice not to have to go looking for a place to eat after being on the road all day! Another of the hotel amenities was the great gym and pool area!! Dosen,t get any better anywhere!!! High end equipment , pool and jacuzzi!, another great perk is, in the morning the from lobby staff give you a $7.00 voucher per person for breakfast in the hotel!!! This is not your average Best Western!! We had a lovely bacon/ egg brkf for $0,,, All the staff were super friendly and seemed like they loved their jobs!!! My only complaint is the fact that people are allowd to smoke in some of the rooms!! Smoking is not segregated by floors!! We instantly could smell cig smoke when we went to the second floor!! We also could smell MJ coming from one room!! To bad this hotel is allowing smoking within especially since they have done such a fine job of renovating!! In this day and age, smoking in hotels or anywhere inside is just not acceptable!! I hope this hotel changes their policy as it would be a shame to ruin such a great Reno,d to new hotel!!",pos

You can walk down the road 0.8 miles to a nice little beach, not good for swimming but perfect for a night time rondevous to just sit and watch the water/fireworks/moon, etc. All hotel personnel were polite and efficient, especially considering it was 4th of July on Cape Cod!! The outdoor swimming pool is perfect, we really enjoyed that one morning. Our only complaint is that the walls are paper thin, you can hear someone sneeze in the next room like they are right in the room with you. There really isn't anything you can do about that though, especially when the hotel is sold out. If you're traveling on a budget and just want a good place to sleep, shower, relax at the pool then this is what you're looking for. Oh, and there is free morning coffee in their on-site diner!",pos

We got a delux suite for same price as suite, but come to find out we could practically reach out and touch the trucks on 385...all night long. Too good to be true, usually is, and was in this case. There were lots of vacancies and they could have placed us in a quieter room, but didn't.",avg
Friendly front desk. Room looked nice/seemed clean but needed refurbishing.

"My husband and I stayed here at a friends recommendation and loved every minute of it. The hotel is excellent and in a great location. Plenty of places to eat and shop close by. The only negative I have to say is the free trolley is not a reliable form of transportation. We walked to the King Street Metro station (14 blocks away) more than we road the trolley, but the walk was beautiful and peaceful. Everyone around was super friendly. We are already talking about going back soon!!",pos
Great stay! Came here for a triathlon and was less then a mile away. Nice place to stay.,pos

We really like this hotel. It's our second visit and both were VERY good. Close to everything we were there to see. Plenty of dining in the area. Even got room service late one night and the plate was good and very fast service. My ONLY suggestion would be to bump up the quality of the breakfast. We will be back and I have recommended it to others traveling to Utica.,pos

"My wife and I went for our anniversary. We were greated by a warm friendly server who was very attentive. The place is very quiet. You can hear the people next to you - every word unless they sit you carefully. Anyhoo, the food: first course - crab on a bed of grapefruit, mixed greens, and yellow peppers. It was unique and good though not a home run. Second course - spicy tomato and fennel soup: outstanding with a great almost citrus-like undertone. The entrees were good but rather uninspired. I had Elk chops that were overcooked with a reduction sauce that didn't quite work. My wife had a Shrimp pasta dish that sounded far more exotic than it was. Desserts were simple yet delicious. Overall: a worthwhile dining experience but not at the same level as the Tree Room in Sundance or the Metropolitan in SLC.",pos
"My wife, 2 dogs and I were evacuated from our home on Hilton Head Island due to Hurricane Matthew. Our initial reservation was for 3 nights but needed to stay additional nights because we were not allowed back to HHI due to storm damage. The first desk clerk (Name) was not friendly or helpful. The day desk clerk Crystal was so helpful and accommodating and worked with us each day to extend our stay, even finding us another room because our first one was booked. She could not have been nicer. This was our first stay at a Holiday Inn Express but Crystal made us want to stay at them in the future.",pos

The hotel has a parking garage with an entrance conveniently located just around the corner.  Not cheap at $29/night and a bit tight in spots, especially for large vehicles such as SUVs (we drive a Prius).  The staff were excellent and they had a decent fitness room--treadmills, elliptical and stationary bikes.  All-in-all, very happy with our experience.",pos

When I told the front desk about the problems, there wasn't anything to be done. I asked if there was an available room in better condition, and the young lady behind the counter stated that all of the rooms are pretty much in the same condition. There even was a water leak that was coming through the walls. Do yourself a favor, find somewhere else to stay.",neg

I didnt see any juices but they did have milk that was warm from being left out. A bit noisy if your room is by the pool since it was a gathering place. The front desk person was very nice. The AC in my room didn't work well. Overall, not a bad place to stay if your on a budget and don't mind an older hotel.",pos

It is difficult to get a cart to take you place to place ( the resort is too hilly so it's hard to walk to your destination in the heat).

"CONS: The front desk was business with a smirk not a smile. This resort is built alongside the non-swimmable beach of Cabo. The views are magnificent but the currents are so strong that you absolutely positively can not get close. YOU WILL DIE NO MATTER HOW GOOD OF A SWIMMER YOU ARE! Four people died in it last month alone! This resort is also build on a huge property alongside a mountain/hill. You will be totally exhausted if you want to walk to any of it's main locations. Fortunately they have drivers driving golf carts to take you everywhere on the property and they are very accessible. The problem is that they also pollute the air with the gasoline smell, which is not very pleasant. Their driveway from start to the lobby is about a 5-7 minute drive. What makes it unpleasant is the entire road is made of beautifully laid pavers which make for a very bump ride. Because this resort is away from the main action (swimmable side of the beach, which I found is still not very swimmable), they have a free shuttle, which was always full, to take you to and from their sister hotel called Rose. I had to pay 14 each way twice to go to the beach. Ana at Rose didn't give a **** that the shuttles couldn't accommodate extra people needing a ride to/from the resort. She refused to be of any assistance saying I was the other hotel's problem. The solution was to book in advance which was still always booked. Anyway, the food was mediocre and very expensive for what you got.",neg

"I was travelling with my (married) female colleague. Our room reservations were screwed up and instead of two rooms, we were informed that we would be put up in a penthouse suite via phone. I appreciated this gesture. Upon arrival, I asked to see the room to ensure it would be appropriate for my traveling companion. Whereas the gentleman who called me up while I was traveling between airports, tactfully explained the situation and reassured me there would be privacy for my traveling companion, the lady who checked us in was apathetic and did not really care whether we stayed or not. The first thing she did was to throw her colleague under the bus by saying she did not know what he said and that we could choose to stay or not. Then, she went on to complain that Expedia often overbooked rooms, and that was Expedia's problem. This has not been my experience with Expedia. I did finally take a look at the suite and my traveling companion accepted the reservation. Later, when I came to use the business centre computer in the lobby, the same employee basically chased me out, claiming she needed to lock up the lobby. Yet, it looked more like she was preparing for bed, and did not want to be disturbed. I worked graveyard in the hospitality industry, and this was by far one of the worst cases of apathy and corporate undermining from an employee I have ever witnessed. After an episode like this, I am hard-pressed to want to visit this hotel, again!",neg

I was happy to see a brand new bed in our room, and the bathroom looked very nice. Until you pulled back the shower curtain. The same old bathtub. Very friendly staff, VERY convenient location. The kitchen lost our room service order, but did take six dollars off the bill. So I would recommend this hotel to others, but I would tell them to wait a while until they get the renos done and sort out a few issues.",avg
"Nice sized pool with large 3ft depth area for the young ones.  Fun little game room, although the hotel might do well to scale back some of the violent shooting games and substitute a few better suites to the under 10 kids.  Adequate game room with pool table and air hockey, nicely located near the center courtyard.  Italian restaurant food good, staff great.",pos

We got a good deal through Expedia for this hotel. Further out of town and the beach than may be comfortable for some but good base from which to explore. Make use of hotel bikes to commute into main town. Ignore staff advice on price of taxis which were far more than the estimate given. 40 euros to viarregio to get the train can easily be avoided by cycling to train station on other side of Forte. Alas we got to know this after spending on the taxi! Rooms could be bigger and a bit of a self catering zone would have been helpful for water and plating up delicious food from the local deli.,avg
"jonathan from 417 says the hotel was nice, not many amenities. the mall is close by, there is a movie theater and restaurants minutes away. the airport was 15 minutes away so was ft. bragg. some of the staff was friendly, one was not.",avg
We stayed here on a road trip. It is located close to the highway exit. I received a large comfortable room on the first floor. Everything was very clean and the beds were comfortable. The breakfast was excellent with many choices. I would stay here again. The front desk staff was pleasant and friendly.,pos
This is the second time we've stayed here. Room was clean. Everything worked well. Staff was very accommodating. We travel with our dog and she liked the room as well! Worth the short drive into the town to get to it. We will be marking this one as one of our favorites.,pos
Excellent value!!,pos
"EXCELLENT!! just can't say that enough. We stayed in a junior jacuzzi suite 3rd floor, it was wonderful. The grounds are so beautiful and well kept. I have never been to a cleaner vacation spot.

"Everything about the hotel was so fantastic!! The decor was so unique and eclectic....and coming from L.A. it was like being at home! The staff were incredibly helpful...I was able to check in early, I ran out of toothpaste and they were nice enough to run some up to my room for me in a matter of minutes. The very best thing about the Hotel Monaco was the location, location, location!! It is centered right in hub of all the action in beautiful Old Town Alexandria. It was perfect and I would definately stay there again!!",pos
The best thing about the hotel is the location. The room was clean but bathroom is in great need of refurbishing. The walls had black marks on them and need either a really good cleaning or fresh coat of paint. The shower tiles have been painted and the paint is peeling on the windowsill so you could see the original color. The staff was very friendly and it is an old hotel but okay if you just need a place to sleep and shower.,neg

"I stayed in this hotel for four nights in June 2016. I thought it was good value for what was offered. Nice breakfast buffet, clean (although pretty dated) room), access to central Torremolinos. The hotel was actually a lot like a cruise ship with organized activities, entertainment, and music playing at the pool. These activities made the hotel a bit noisy from the pool facing room I had. Especially since I was sleeping at strange hours due to jet lag. I'm sure it's nice if you're looking for that type of thing but it became a bit annoying having bands playing, bingo, or fitness classes always going over the speakers when I wanted to sleep. Other than that, I enjoyed and would stay again if I needed a nice cheap, clean, convenient spot in Torremolinos.",pos
This hotel was nice. Nothing extra. The staff was very pleasant and accommodating. Would stay here again.,pos
"Hotel was very convenient to the freeway. Was also close to the people we came to visit. The room was clean, and the breakfast was very good. Will likely stay there again when we come back to visit.",pos
"I was welcomed by a very pleasant and professional staff. I had just flown in and lost my phone at the TSA check in the airport from where I took off, so I was a bit agitated. I explained my dilemma and although I was extremely early they did their best to get a room available and gave me directions to the t-mobile store so I could get a replacement phone. By the time I returned the room was ready and the woman who checked me in had a message from my wife and she read it aloud to me in such a nice way. I was really impressed by the welcome and all the help. The room was nicely decorated and I was just looking to take a shower and relax a bit before I went to meet up with some friends. And there it was... black mold in the shower. Clearly visible and of course once I saw it I looked under some of the fixtures in the shower and found a lot more. Gross. Other than that the room was basically very comfortable. Air conditioning worked well. Television worked well. Free WiFi was a treat. Outlets galore for your cell phones, tablets, laptops etc. Really efficient room. Pool was nice. Fitness room was clean and modern facilities. It was so difficult to actually get someone to assist you in the restaurant that I walked out twice and found someplace else to eat. That and the black mold were the only negative aspects. I would definitely stay there again. Oh and the self parking made for easy mobility if you rent a car. If not, use uber as the cab cost 3x more.",avg
"This hotel was just okay for a night's stay. The counter staff was visibly not happy that we booked from hotels.com and would not allow an upgrade that was available otherwise. The sleeper sofa is barely larger than a twin bed although they claim it is queen size. If you plan on 2 kids using it, they better be toddlers or smaller. There is also a smell outside that comes from the river that can't be ignored. The rooms are clean enough but I would recommend a different choice in a nicer location.",avg
Great stay - just wish they had a free breakfast,pos
"The room was a good size and the air condition was really good. No complaints. It's less than 10 minutes walk to the cathedral, so really central. Would highly recommend!",pos

"Given the limited options for a hotel in Warren, PA, this Holiday Inn is by far the best one. Hotel staff was pleasant and efficient, the bar is very nice and the food is good. I didn't visit the pool, but it looked nice. The rooms are a little dated and musty, but were clean and good enough.",pos

"The internet on the sixth floor almost never worked. The did however give me another room on the fourth floor. But this didn't solve my problem of the cleaning staff of replenishing my towel after removing them from the room. I stayed for 14 days at least seven of those days I asked for towels. At least four times I had to ask for new room keys because the room access cards quit working. The printer in the business center printer did not print properly. The front desk called my room to tell me my taxi was waiting for me, whom I thought a friend sent to me. Turns out no one never called a taxi for me. The motel sent me someone else's taxi who I gladly took a ride in to my friends house to find out they never sent me a taxi. I paid for a taxi ride I didn't need because my friends were getting ready to come pick me up. I checked out early and the motel didn't want to comp me for checking out early. Guess I will stay somewhere else next time.",avg

"I usually stay in about 20 to 30 different hotels a year and this place was by far the worst. The room was very dirty with spiderwebs, obvious stains on the chairs, items (dirty towels) left from the previous guests and the bed was a little scary to sleep in (we ended up sleeping in our sleeping sacks) . The doors to the building don't lock and the furniture of the rooms urgently needs replacement: TV from the 80s, toilet having issues flushing, the curtain kept falling of the track, the window lock would not close securely the windows were dirty and lights did not sufficiently illuminate the room. The worst thing however is the breakfast. Not only that the buffet is small and lacks fresh or healthy options the hotel personnel used their bare hands to refill food. In general the people working at the Guesthouse Inn miss a service-minded work attitude. Communication with guests is done while chewing gum and chatting with their relatives and the hotel employees have breakfast in the same room and at the same time as the guests and still fail to identify the need for refills. We felt safer and cleaner out camping and will definitely not stay at this place again.",neg
"This was our first road trip with our grandson, and we were very nervous about everything, but the cleanliness of the room help us to relax, the breakfast was very good, but you need more cereal, lol. The staff was very friendly and helpful.",pos
"I have never written a review like this and thought the previous reviewers were exaggerating or just expecting too much from a Holiday Inn Express. I was wrong. Clearly, the hotel is trying very hard to cover up an unpleasant smell, and with no way to open a window or gain access to fresh air, the smell is truly overwhelming. When we first arrived, I thought the smell in the lobby was bad (a combination of stale smoke, damp must, and something they have sprayed to try to cover it up) but the smell in our room was even worse. There was no relief from it because the windows are sealed shut and it was too late for us to find another hotel.",neg
Awesome place! The owners are great and the beds were AWESOME!!,pos
"We just returned from another perfect stay in Cancun at the Excellence Riviera celebrating our anniversary. It more than met our expectations again! It was great to meet others who were also returnees! The staff are what makes Excellence stand out above others. Everyone greets you...whether pulling weeds from the landscape, emptying trash bins or serving you directly....the smiles and greetings give you a feeling of joy. We stayed 7 days and were not disappointed with ANYTHING! Lots of folks avoided the beach due to the seaweed but this is nature's doing and not Excellence's. However, they tried to remove as much as possible and we got into the warm water despite the ugliness of it and feeling. Once we crossed over the slimy stuff and got out past the seaweed it was good. However, the lazy river, pools, and jacuzzi hot tubs were as great and relaxing. If you are looking for a place that has excellent food (all the restaurants are 5 star and amazingly wonderful), excellent service, super cleanliness, serenity, yet ability to enjoy some water sports, facitlity games, relaxation, outstanding shows in the evenings, no kids ( I love kids but not on my vacation), adult only---- then this is the place for you. Shout out to the Lobster House Horatio....treated us like royalty!!! Chez Isabelle (French Restaurant) and Basmati (Indian restaurant) were my two new favorites. The housekeeping staff kept our room spotless and comfortable. The drinks are good...not watered down..Enjoy!",pos

We flew in and didn't rent a car so we walked everywhere we wanted to go and it was great. It's close to the Harbour, shopping and lots of restaurants and historic attractions. If you aren't into walking the free shuttle runs on King Street and is very easy to access. They have free pick up at the airport and also for your return. No in room coffee which I missed but coffee and teas available in the lobby every morning which was nice and a wine reception in the afternoon. If we ever go back to Alexandria we wouldn't stay anywhere else.",pos
Overall it was pretty nice. About what you would expect from a Holiday Inn Exp. Only issue we had was it is a little hard to find and the room cleaners knocked on the door at 830 and then about every fifteen min for the next hour. The guy was dressed in plain clothes and we could see his cart so the first few times we didn't even realize he was a cleaner.,pos

Rooms were being renovated and updated. Only downside was the elevator was out of order but was being fixed the next day.,pos

"My husband and I stayed at Tree Tops which is in Bearfoot Resort, but managed by Elk Springs Resort. Up until our stay, I received emails to keep me posted on the status of our reservation. I also received a phone call to confirm before Elk Springs charged my credit card for the remainder of our fees. Everyone I spoke to was extremely courteous and professional. The day of our arrival, we received a phone call to let us know the cabin was clean and ready for our arrival, along with information about the door and security codes. After mentioning that our arrival would be well after dark, we arrived at the cabin to find the porch light and most of the interior lights were left on for us. The cabin was absolutely adorable. The two large flat screen televisions were awesome for watching Saturday's games. The kitchen had not only the basics, but good quality cookware and every small appliance we could possibly need to cook meals during our stay. The best part was the views from the two covered porches. Whether grilling out, rocking in the gliders or eating a meal on the upper level porch, the views of Mt. LeConte were breathtaking! On the lower level, we could enjoy the view from the hot tub or swing, which were my personal favorites! This cabin was a little more expensive than some we've stayed in previously, but it was by far the nicest. We agreed that we will definitely be contacting Elk Springs next time we visit the Smokies!",pos

Sent email to Hotel manager, he started talking about money and Santo Domingo policies. Customer Service did NOT exist in his book.

"We were pleased with a 1-night stay in this hotel. The renovated rooms are very nice, clean and pretty large considering it's LA. This hotel used to offer free parking and now since it's been renamed 'the Kinney' they only offer valet parking for 15. Not super expensive but I would have liked it to be free as I booked it when it was The Inn at Marina Del Rey which offered free parking. The only thing that was not great was the fact that the lobby, corridors and some common areas were under construction. The front desk area smelled of fresh paint and there were constantly workers around. Breakfast was surprisingly good, with scrambled eggs, bacon and a waffle station, with a very nice lady attendant. This hotel was about 15 minute walking from Venice beach and restaurants located next to it.",pos

She placed our order for drinks the bar actually WAITED 4 them to finish instead of coming back taking our food orders..this took 20 min...strike 2. She came back w/ our drinks we placed our dinner order. Afterwards, she went MIA again until our food came out!..strike 3. Meanwhile our drinks water were empty!! When our food arrived we informed her that we needed more drinks water refills. She went to get the drinks again we didnt see her 4 another 20 min!!..strike 4. When she came back w/ the drinks she dropped them off immediately fled the scene w/o asking us how our food turned out!..strike 5. We ate our food my friends that had problems w/ their food regretfully ate theirs 2. About 20minutes later, the MGR came over 2 ask us about service. Not wanting to get the waiter in trouble we laughed it off waited 4 our check. Another 20min passed we flagged down the MGR confessed of the bad service said we needed our check...strike 6. He apologized had the server bring us our check. She slammed the check down on the table, rolled her eyes walked off. That was it!!..strike 7. We went found the MGR told him what happened. We had a 300 bill 50 of it was her gratuity tip!! We couldnt let this happen! The MGR adjusted her tip off our total sent her back over to collect the money. She was really pised now. It took 1 hr to cash our table out when we tried to see why, she stood the register w/ another waiter told him 2 stay nearby bcause she may need back up 2 handle these biches!! OMG!!

There was also small damages on furniture that I have noticed. The room did have a slight musty smell every time I entered the room. Also, I was not a fan of the air-conditioner because it was so loud and you can feel the air blowing on you. I'm the type of person who does not like the feel of air blowing on me. At times, you can hear house keeping talking or your neighbors through the wall. Overall, the resort was cute and nice. The free breakfast every AM was a plus. The indoor poor was smaller than I expected but it was nice. My stay was during the winter so I did not experience the outdoor pool or the fire-pit.",pos

When we arrived check in was quick and easy front desk staff was very friendly. Our room was a handicapped room, which was not an issue for us. The room was missing some essential items. There was no toilet paper so I had to go down to get some and there was no spare blanket in the closet for the sofa bed. So I had to make another trip to get items that are almost always in the rooms already. The next night I needed to get some ice but I needed another ice bag so I went down stairs to ask for another bag and the front desk staff filled it up for me right there so I didn't have to make an extra trip to the ice machine.

Had to stop and ask twice for directions & still almost missed it. It sits way back from the highway. Needs better signs. Room appeared clean, but there was an old apple core in the cup with the coffee condiments. Entry from the back parking lot was up several steps which was hard for me with suitcase & other items. No sloping ramp to either rear entrance Parking was ample & hidden behind hotel, so privacy or fear of car break in was no issue. Good variety for continental breakfast, but no juices available to drink. Front desk service was exceptionally good both evening and morning. Very helpful. Complimentary computer service and printing assistance when I needed to print air travel boarding passes.

We specifically picked this hotel because of the great rate on Hotels.com, and the close proximity to the MARTA station. when we arrived, we were given a king bedroom, but it didn't include a sofa bed, which is what we specifically booked since there were three of us sharing. The staff quickly remedied the situation and got us in the correct style of room. The room was very clean and comfy. The shower is a bit strange in that the glass only goes halfway across, so water spills out and soaks the floor/bathmat. Also, there's not much space to put your shampoo, etc. The continental breakfast was pretty standard, but our one complaint is that they didn't always have everything set up by the time breakfast started. The area around is pretty quiet, and you are within walking distance to the Perimeter mall and another shopping center with a grocery store and restaurants. All in all, it was a great hotel and we would definitely consider staying there again in the future.",pos

We checked in late our first night and the women at the desk was extremely friendly.. I believe her name started with an S or something. Our stay was great. We enjoyed our cozy room. Everything worked fine. Everything was decently clean and comfortable. My only complaint was a few of the housekeepers were very rude and acted annoyed if we were still in our room when them came to clean and asked to come a bit later. As well as a few of the mornings when we went to enjoy the free breakfast, some housekeepers sat and watched what we did and what we ate and how much we took. I was even told that I took ""too many plates"" when I actually needed them since I was bringing food back for my daughter and fiancée. And while we ate I was stared at and talked about. Another quick thing was they don't have any working cribs for guests who need them which definitely caused issues when it came to sleeping at night. But other than that everything was great.",pos

We were given a second room which had the electrical messed up. When the kitchen light was turned on, the bedroom closet light also turned on and the bathroom lights were also connected to the other kitchen lights. The coffee pot did not work either even though it was plugged in. The room was very nice though and clean. I believe once all the construction and updates are finished it will be a very nice hotel.",avg
"Wow, how this place is up and running. A very sad place. This motel has everything a bad motel needs to have to be a horror place to stay. Dirty floors, no bath towels, thugs, nasty tattoo hookers, and verbal fights at 3am. I'm so glad my son stayed with me parents and not to be here for this stay.",neg

Very nice rooms and beds, room service offered everyday. I would gladly stay here again and again. Thank you to all the staff and owners!",pos
"Location here is absolutely stellar, makes you feel like you're a local. Quick access to Frenchman street through the back gate, just far enough away to be quiet in the evening, and a good jaunt away from Bourbon Street (but also close enough, if that's your vibe). A small fridge in the room would have upped my rating a full star, it was HOT out, and chilling water bottles in the ice bucket wasn't ideal. Rooms were nice, and pretty clean (it probably could have used a deep clean, I wound up dusting the base boards) Would have been great to get a little more light in there, the only windows we had looked directly at the room directly across the walkway, so we were stuck with the blackout curtains closed majority of the time in the room. I'd grab a bigger room next time around, we didn't realize exactly how HOT it is in July, so we had more time to relax at the hotel than anticipated and a separate sitting area in our own space would have been a game changer. Pool was great, sitting out by the pool was great, staff was super friendly!",pos
I had a family funeral to attend and this hotel is so convenient to everything.,pos
"Nice hotel and not far from the University Place area. Free breakfast. Restaurants are very close on the same road as the hotel (McCollough). My only issue is that the Expedia description said that the jacuzzi room had a sofa bed but it doesn't. That's not a big deal, but if my 5 year old would've stayed with us it would've changed things. Again, that's a very minor issue maybe not the hotel's fault. Regardless, it is a very nice hotel and I will stay there again.",pos

"Nice, comfortable hotel. Friendly staff and nice rooms. A short stay but enjoyable. Enjoyed the kitchenette. Pretty much like other Candelwoods we have visited. They are not fancy but are quiet comfortable and reasonabley priced.",pos
"I chose this hotel because of their private beach area. No umbrellas/coolers at the beachonly foam coolers purchased from their gift shop allowed. They have umbrella spots you can use, unless someone rented the spot already. There is no other shade other than those area, so rent or get there early. It's about 400 to rent a jetski for the day. But take a 10 minute drive over the bridge to the other side of the river, entire day Jet Ski rental runs about 130. I guess the extra price is the convenience of not having to drive 10 minutes away. Pool area is basic and they need to put bathrooms in the pool area and closer to the beach area. Food was pricey based on quality. Not many healthy choices. When you get tired of eating greasy heavy food, your only choice is a fruit plate. I ordered a chicken caesar salad to keep it light and it was heavy too. You can order food directly on the beach. There was a server named Anthony down there and his awesome service made up for the not so great food. Room view was nice, ac worked great, and bathroom was clean. Room was outdated but seemed clean. There isn't anything exciting or praise worthy about the room itself, its about what you get at a Motel 6. My daughter slept in one of the beds in our room was attacked by bed bugs. Poor baby had a massive amount of bites up both sides of her stomach. On both her sides it went from her hip up to her armpit. I definitely wasn't happy about this and wont be returning.",neg
I was there for 3 days and 2 nights. The lobby area was nice. The breakfast in the morning was decent. The room was nice and quiet and the bed was very comfortable. What I did notice was that the hotel common areas were not very well maintained. The tile floor outside the elevators on my floor had coffee spills on them for the whole time I was there. The tile floor in one of the elevators was cracked and falling apart. The other elevator was missing the covers for the lights in the ceiling so the flourescent tubes were all exposed. The elevators were very slow and creaked alot. The carpet in the hallway in front of my room needed to be vacuumed very badly and it remained unvacuumed the whole time I was there. The pool area was nice and seemed to be kept clean. It seemed like with a little bit of effort it could look alot better.,avg

"I would actually give the hotel a 3.5 star rating. It was clean and the customer service provided by the staff was professional and courteous. Also, the morning breakfast offered a good variety of food. The only negatives were 1) the size of the elevator. There was no way that regular size luggage would have fit in it. My wife and I had to squeeze in just to get our carry on bags to fit. 2) The bed was somewhat small. Because of my height (6'2), I had to sleep with my legs slightly bent in order to not have them hang over the edge. Other than that, we had a good experience.",avg

I had a severe allergic reaction and was not able to attend. I didn't think anything of it until I received by credit card bill with a charge of 132.00!! When I called, the front desk lady/manager Diane was extremely rude and told me there was no way her employee would have told me that there was no cancellation fee. When I told her maybe the employee made a mistake, she said there was no way he would make that mistake and called me a liar. When I stated that sometimes employees make mistakes and I was positive I had asked about cancel fees, she said that was impossible and that I was wrong and every single hotel in the entire world(!!) charges cancellation fees. After a heated argument, I asked for the corporate number to make a complaint. I explained to the corporate office that I had been sick and was unable to attend and had been given no indication that there would be a cancellation charge (full cost for the over priced room). She was very nice and sympathetic and I confirmed that I could get a doctors note proving I was ill. She said that the Hotel owner or GM would call me to discuss and I would possibly have to provide the doctors note. That was over a week ago and I haven't heard from anyone.

I thought I had to check out at the desk, but was then told that hotels.com would email my receipt which they did. I just wish I knew the checkout proceedures prior to checking out.",avg

"Stayed for just a quick night. Was pleasantly surprised. This looks as if it were once an old crummy hotel but they really did try with the upgrades. Carpet looked a little dirty and it looked as if someone wrote graffiti on the mirror at one time, but it had been cleaned. The bathroom was clean, the shower worked just great. They do skimp on the towel and toilet tissue quality but compared to the other hotels on this street, I definitely felt safer and cleaner here.",avg

My daughter was moving into Mizzou so we went up the night before I made the reservations online I must say when I walked into the lobby of the hotel seem older but nice I then checked into my room went and got something to eat came back use the restroom to see two tiny bugs not sure what they were at this point I killed them and wanted to my room saw a roach crawling up my drink when I called the front desk I told the guy I have bugs in my room he said yes as if this were a regular occurrence and then took him about 15 minutes to get me moved to a different room to say the least I was absolutely mortified this hotel is disgusting,neg

Very rude front desk. Never mentioned they charge for people. They only asked how many beds. Once we check in they charged us for extra people. 4 for 2 queens. Rooms smell moldy.

"We were greeted with the utmost elegance when we got out of our taxi, we didn't have to lift a finger to carry anything - checking in took all of 20 seconds to sign a few bits of paperwork, then we were allowed to catch our breath with a cold drink before we were taken to our floor.Our room was one of the cheaper basic rooms by Mandarin standard however it could be compared to other hotels absolute best offerings!Calling room service always had a personalised greeting (caller ID), inroom dining was fantastic for a late night feast with some fresh salad and berries, rooms are kept immaculately clean and you always have plenty of towels and extras.Dining at breakfast time was superb as well, we showed up 20 minutes before end of breakfast and they still accommodated us wonderfully in a stunning restaurant by the garden offering traditional indonesian, japanese and international cuisine all for the buffet price. Think - smoked salmon, crisp pastries, espresso machine coffee made just for you, and even fresh sushi and sashimi made to order.Checking out time was flexible and arranged perfectly so that we could leave our bags for an hour at the hotel which we did not expect after previous experiences.We were treated like kings by the hotel staff during our stay, as a first experience of a 5 star hotel it was just great.Simply an elegant hotel offering what we all want - great service and accomodation!",pos

Then she had me sign the Hotels.com (Expedia) receipt, showing me their price for the room. The hotel and the room itself were older but the room was large. The beds however were very unstable and rocked or bounced from side to side. My wife also found a few black beetles in her bed. It served its purpose as a place to stay for the night but I would not recommend this hotel if you have another choice.",neg

The second day there was more staff but the waitress decided to change my plain yogurt to blueberry. I am allergic. Had to send it back. I asked for a manager to contact me but no one called. Called corporate and they wanted to give me points. Called Mr. Kong, the president of Best Western and they will give me a 50.00 credit, the first offer was a gift certificate for 50.00 No thanks, I wont ever stay in another Best Western again.

"It's modest, but clean ... and a refrigerator We were road-tripping across the country for a move from Chicago to LA when our alternator blew. After being towed into town, our tow truck driver brought us to Traveler's Inn on 4th Street. Because we were moving, we had our dog and cat in tow, so we needed a pet friendly option, and this modest motel filled the bill. The room was pretty basic, but it was clean, and there was a small refrigerator to store our wine. The TV had cable including HBO. There also is a pool out front, but it was closed as it was still early in the spring. The motel also is AAA approved, so if you have a card, you get a discount. There are a few nearby dining options, too, including a Taco John's and a old-time diner. Convenience stores also dot 4th street. Overall, it was very comfortable, pet friendly and cheap. Just what we needed for our short stay in North Platte.",neg

"Hotel front desk guy sounded like a robot. Didn't even say hello as we walked in. Just said Name and i told him my name. He took me down and then just flipped open a map and then told us our room, followed by here are your keys and walked back to his desk. He honestly looked like he hated his job and wanted to kill himself because of it. We proceeded to go to the room which had a musty gross smell to it. Turned on the A/C and it made the room smell more gross. The floor had sticky stuff in certain areas and was disgusting. Then WiFi barely worked, luckily i was able to use my phone to tether. The only good thing about this room was the comfy king size bed. I asked for late checkout and the guy told me he can only give me till 11:15-11:30 at the latest, other hotels i've stayed at at least give until 12 or 1pm without an issue. I have stayed at quality inn's before and the room quality and front desk service has always been great. Not to mention the neighborhood is horrible. I will not be staying here again. My advice to anyone looking to book this hotel is just spend the extra 30-40 a night and get yourself a nicer hotel closer to the coast.",neg

Would like to point out, those not from the area, the water did smell funny, but not Hotels fault I only mention it for others I have seen reviews in the JAX area. It's the water of the area, unless you know a hotel with a filtration system, they will all smelly sulfury.",pos

"We went to Monterrey for a weekend getaway and love our stay at Merrit!! The rooms are rustic, spacious, and perfect for a couple. The fireplace was great, almost no noise at night, and was the perfect location.

We would definitely stay here again!",pos
"We really enjoyed the history behind the the Lamothe House and the location can't be beat! Our room was spacious, the bed was awesome and despite being so close to sometimes raucous Frenchmen Street, we couldn't hear a thing when we finally made it back to our room after a long day of exploring, eating and having fun. The surrounding area is much preferred over the French Quarter because there is less noise and less of that oh-so familiar Bourbon Street smell. The only draw back was that the alley way to our room was a tad narrow and dark at night but the great, secure parking more than made up for it. We will most definitely return!",pos
Considering the other prices for San Francisco hotels this one was a good choice. Cheaper then the rest and good location! The rooms are very nice and there is free parking!

The lobby has a couple of attractive and comfortable seating areas, in addition to a small bar. I had a lovely double room with its own patio, a spacious and beautifully appointed bathroom, and ample closet space. There was also a mini-bar and in-room safe. The hotel provides free wireless internet and it is quite fast. Breakfast was included, and was quite elaborate: fruit, cheeses, charcuterie, breads, eggs, bacon, juices. Coffee drinks are provided on request. There is a rooftop terrace with tables, chairs, and umbrellas for warm, sunny days... alas, I was there in winter! I look forward to my next stay. *The one thing that made me knock off a point is the absence of a ramp to allow easy transport of suitcases up the 3 flights of stairs from the parking lot up to the lobby.",pos

I could clearly hear every word and movement from our next-door neighbors, who were drunk on Saturday night but not being unreasonably loud. You can always hear certain muffled noises in hotels, but this was incredible. I literally could have joined in their conversation, I could hear everything perfectly. We should have realized because we could hear the maids earlier in the day. It may be confined to the top floor, all the noise was coming from the ceiling / top of wall.",neg

"The hotel is centrally located, and the room was spacious and beautifully furnished. The other facilities are tastefully decorated, but small, given the grandeur the hotel is trying to portray. There are amenities, but with nearly everything with this hotel, it comes at an additional cost (parking, wifi, etc). The staff is friendly, but lacking a professional demeanor, and information regarding services and benefits provided will only come if you know to ask (wine and breakfast). We looked forward for some time to staying here, and now that we have, it is unlikely that we'll repeat.",pos
"We have stayed in this hotel a couple of times over the years just for a quick couples getaway. There are a lot of great improvements, the restaurant was very good.

Overall, the price is right, the food is great and the staff very friendly !",pos

"This hotel has had some of its rooms recently renovated. The building itself looks quite old, the elevator sounds and looks like it's about to fall apart. However the rooms inside are quite modern, neat, tidy. Basic but just what you need for an average priced stay near Lihue. Bed comfortable but some of the pillows had a slight dewy smell to them. Pool and jacuzzi nice. Restaurant small but good selection of meals and staff are very helpful in giving you suggestions of nearby eateries. One washing machine and dryer for the whole place was sometimes a nightmare (although it is free). Parking easy and free. WIFI signal too weak to be used on iPhones when we were in our room, weak signal can be picked up on a laptop. In the lobby the signal is strong and fast. The location of this hotel works well as you have easy access to the north and south. Overall a good comfortable stay, daily maid service was thorough. Hotel has good potential especially when they have finished renovations, established a concierge etc. would stay here again if visiting Kauai",avg
Staff wasn't helpful. Room smelled like cigarettes and mildew. No knobs to adjust ac unit. Didn't get the room I had booked. And it was really expensive! Grand Junction has much better hotels for that price!,neg

"I arrived late and they were there. She was very friendly explained to me the policies and gave me a map and list of near by places to eat and things to see. The hotel looks average from the pictures and I was afraid that for the price, it would be a bad place. But it was very good, maybe the best hotel I had in weeks. Bed was gigantic, and super soft. Bed sheets felt like silk. The bathroom was small. And the room was a weird layout. it was in ground floor and the only door was a glass sliding door. The blinds worked fine but my girlfriend felt a little exposed. The room had a window a/c which worked fine and was placed in the right spot, the whole room was cool and I never felt wind in my face. the pool was refreshing, tiki bar was nice. The hotel was kind of difficult to find, first there is no sing/ I didnt see one, It says Marathon Key but Marathon is long and made of different keys. If you go, Look for the gas station and Publix supermarket, make right turn behind super market. there is a beach a short distance from the hotel, rated as one of the best in the Keys...I didnt get to see it. too bad. It took barely 1 hr to go to key west from it.",pos

He always leaves his orange hunting knife on top of his clothes, but it was under his sweatshirt and a few other things when we got back. The screen onthe door to get on the patio was ripped from the bottom and up the side. The curtain was detached from the stick that you use to open and close them. I was not impressed with the stay. Not worth 120 a night.",neg

"I am from old town, and I stayed in this hotel with my mom on her visit.  It had been under renovations for over a year or so, and I was really excited to see what they had done.  It was a beautiful room, view, location.  The decorating is eclectic in a very modern way, but there is still an ""old world"" kind of feel.  The amenities were great (the shower was fantastic, love the hardware!), and the concierge helped us with everything.  It is the only hotel in Old Town with a doorman.  I would never have guessed, but there is a pool on the third floor.  The restaurant downstairs (Jackson 20) is very hip and swanky to go for a drink, and dinner there is very good as well.  I can't wait to go there when it warms up to take advantage of the courtyard and balconies.",pos

"On the plus side, check-in was fast and friendly. Room was very clean as was fridge mattress was firm, not sagging/worn out. Basic breakfast (waffles, cereal, pastries, fruit). Hall was noisy due to doors and wood construction (I wear ear plugs anyway). As a tip, if you need a ground floor room ask for it in that I don't believe they have an elevator for the second floor. Parking was odd, front and rear entrance, but very little parking in front. Lot was well lit though so I did not feel unsafe. At first I was hesitant to stay in a Super 8 but would book this one again if I had the need.",pos

"Main problem was with air conditioning in the room and the hotel's failure to address the situation properly. When room temp reached 74 degrees (set on 68) I called the front desk. We were assured an engineer would be up immediately. 20 minutes later--I called again. Front desk had no record of the first call. By now the room temp was 82 degrees. The front desk assured us the problem would be dealt with. We left for the day and returned 7 pm. The a/c was STILL not repaired and the front desk had no progress report for us, no update, nothing. Our impression was that maybe they were hoping we wouldn't bring up the issue again. We asked for an immediate move to another room and were moved within 20 minutes.Second, smaller issue: we were in town to attend a funeral at Arlington Cemetery. The night before, my son needed his shoes shined. We called the front desk and were told to put the shoes outside our door, and they would be ready in the morning. Next morning: shoes had not been touched. When I complained to the front desk, I was told: ""Why didn't you bring them down to the desk? That's what you should have done.""Bottom line: this is a nicely redecorated hotel in a prime Old Town Alexandria location, but I won't be staying there again.",neg

"I needed a cheap place to stay for 3 nights to attend my son's graduation from basic training. This place satisfied that requirement.Pluses: Close to Lackland AFB (7 mi, 10-15 min during low traffic, 45 min during high traffic). Refrigerator in room. Close to restaurants and grocery store (Walmart Supercenter). There is a pool (I didn't use it) and on Fridays, they have a ""fiesta"" with free nachos and 2 free drinks. Also, the staff was very friendly and helpful.Minuses: The elevator was very dirty (I was on the 2nd floor), and it stank when the humidity was high. My room stank when I checked in, but after running the A/C it got tolerable. The mattress was hard, but I can sleep anywhere.Additional info: There seemed to be a lot of families staying there for the same reason as me--cheap and close to base. The parking lot is lighted and monitored by security camera 24/7. I saw kids playing in the pool, people looked happy. I did not feel unsafe, but some people might be scared off by the neighborhood (those used to more high-end places).There are places closer to base, but they were either booked up or more expensive (even the Motel 6 was considerably higher-priced than this place).I would stay here again if my needs were the same (cheap and close to base).",avg

Breakfast was really good room was comfortable. Too expensive for what you get book online for better prices!",avg
We stayed the night during the week. Of the staff people we talked to they were all very friendly.

I don't remember booking a pet-friendly room--I sure didn't do it on purpose, but he lectured me about using expedia and making sure I check whether the room was listed as pet-friendly.

The morning breakfast was included with the stay, It wasn't the greatest but it filled my empty stomach, and the coffee was okay too. The other thing that I really liked about this hotel is that we were able to get an extended stay until 6:00pm for 25.00 which was fantastic since our flight was very late in the night, this allowed us to rest and shower, then go out to dinner before we went to the airport.

I called the hotel. they told me the smaller charge was a mistake by the hotel staff. the 150 charge was a fee as they claimed I smoked in the room. I explained that I do not smoke and whoever said that I had smoked in the room was in error and these charges were bogus and fraudulent. The hotel promised they would get back to me the same day. That was yesterday and I still haven't received the call.I would not recommend anyone stay there and also be sure to check your bank statements.",neg

MUCH better than expecting for that much money. The night before we stayed at the Calhan hotel and it no bueno, to say the last.",pos
"This place was miserable. It took over 20 minutes to check in. There was only one towel in the room and its cleanliness was questionable. Upon requesting additional towels, we were promised more towels, but they never made it. Every horizontal surface had cigarette burns on it. There was no chair to sit on to work at the desk. The room smelled bad. There was no shower head. The security lock on the door was broken. We will pitch a tent on the side of the highway before we stay here again.",neg

Only saving grace was microwave and fridge in room and pool area was pleasant.",neg
"Country Inns And Suites are always great places to stay. This was the first time we ever had to wait to get in our room because of the housekeeping was running behind. I understand these things happen but that was one reason i couldn't give this hotel a higher rating. Breakfast was good but breakfast room could be bigger or maybe a patio area for more seating . Pool area was very nice with plenty of towels and was very clean as was the rest of the hotel. One thing i should mention is that a couple days before my wife and i were supposed to stay there i realized i made reservations for the wrong dates ! I called Hotels.com and they contacted this hotel and made the change for the correct dates, thank you so much to Hotels.com and Country Inns And Suites for your understanding!",pos

Great visit for the Annual Rock and Gem Show. Room was wonderful and the hotel is centrally located - far enough away from the chaos while close enough to be near everything.

In addition to the Abbey being a fantastic venue, they also supplied us with the names of some amazing vendors.

"well this hotel is terrible to say the least maybe the worst hotel i have ever stayed at. Let me start off the 1st room they gave us was dirty and nasty. we checked in around 6:00pm and the room wasn't clean there were dirty dishes in the dish washer. garbage was never changed. the sheets on the bed were dirty and not clean my daughter found a cigarette butt in her bed. Called down they changed our room to a new thought this would be ok but no. dirty dishes in the dish washer again. No shower curtain in the bathroom and on top of that a half of role of toilet paper. the fold out couch bed didn't even have sheets on it. One of the reasons i book this hotel was for the breakfast. What a joke all it had was coffee, muffins and breakfast bars and if u want t o call it fresh fruit. No juice for the kids nothing. did not know i was suppose to give coffee to a 11 yr old. If it would have said grab and go i would have never booked it. NEVER AGAIN will i book this hotel or use this site anymore...",neg
The sheets would not stay on the bed....The mattress was very uncomfortable...Everything on the bed was old and cheap....When I say cheap...I mean prison cheap...The quality of the t.v was poor....The screen was dark and the channels were unclear...The continental breakfast was sorry....I paid for 2 nights but was ready to leave after the first night...If it was not for the game being in town and limited hotel availability...I would have left....The hotel is in bad need of updating...,neg

Non alberto intimo ma ha tanti servizi, 3 piscine di cui una riscaldata a 26 da poter usare tutto l'anno, due ristoranti. Personale presente e gentile. Cibo al ristorante molto vario ed abbastanza buono (non la pasta ma cosa si pretende). La cosa migliore i frullati di frutta a colazione. Hotel frequentato soprattutto da anglosassoni e tedeschi. Note dolenti: materassi non tanto comodi, wi-fi di una lentezza da primi anni di internet: in pratica inesistente. Il mare davanti all'hotel fanstatico con 3 calette di bellissima sabbia e acqua bellissima. Idem per il lungomare curato e tutto pedonale.

"Let me just say I will never book thru Expedia ever again. I checked in on 4/16/15 and checked out on 4/22/15 and let me say I want a refund or to be put up for what I originally paid for the El Dorado Royal. On 2/8/15 I booked thru Expedia and paid in FULL for 6 nights/7 days all inclusive at the Royale. On 4/8/15 exactly 60 days I get an email from Expedia stating that the Royale is overbooked by 17 reservations and I will be moved to Generations resort. That is a problem because I booked originally Adults Only and Generations has kids. The only other sister property available was Seaside Suites so I went on Karisma's website and it appeared to be similar. We arrive on 4/16/15 and the rooms are small older resort that what was expected but fine. The sewer/moldy smell from water retention outside our door was gross. I complained to personal concierge and they acted as if it wasn't an issue. Interesting enough people we met and check in on same day got moved to building because it was so bad and they even tried a dehumidifier. We never got offered a move, etc. Our 2nd full day we both came down very ill with diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration. We at first just said oh maybe it's Mexico. No, we finally saw the doctor on site and were given an antibiotic, bacterial medication and pain med for stomach. Our friends we were traveling with too were so sick and others in resort we met at well from Canada, Australia, Philadelphia, California, etc. There is something not right. The",neg

"Got there a little late as the wine tasting was over. We had been trying to wait as a violent storm pushed ahead of us. We were successful, but it put us checking into the hotel after 10:00 at night. By the time we got everything unpacked and settled into the beautiful and well-appointed room, only a few items were still being delivered 24/7 by rooms service. The food and its service was my only disappointment.The brocolli cheese soap was cold when we got it, but the hummus was well-warmed to a degree that would have better suited the soup.My mother didn't received any napkins or utensils, so I shared my knife with her for the hummus/pitas.I ended up pulling out some travel napkins from my bag. I wish there had been a coffee maker in the room, but we ordered a carafe of it for breakfast.So those were the annoyances, but the room was so gorgeous felt roomy and was so well-appointed and comfortable. The linens and pillows were top of the line and it felt as though we were in capable and caring hands.I look forward staying here again.",pos

When we went to go sightseeing the door would not latch closed. we told the desk staff, they said someone would be there in 10 minutes to fix it after waiting 45 minutes, we went back to the desk and said either refund our money, give us a new room or fix it now. Someone came within 5 minutes. the entire door lock mechanism had to be replaced and so we did not get an early start to our day. When we returned, we found a wash cloth with a large soda/drink on the counter by the tv, not ours the beds had not been made, although the towels were replaced. I took the drink to the desk and expained it was in the room, and told her the beds had not been made either. the complimentary breakfast was coffee and tea, juice, and bread that could be toasted, with grape jelly and a butter substitut And a bowl of apples, much less than I would have expected.",avg

We could also hear the elevator door dinging. With the air on the noises were muffled enough to not be problematic. Still, expect more from a Hilton. The rates were reasonable, the staff excellent, and if not for the noise the room would have been excellent as well. We did have housekeeping attempt to just freshen up our bed linen rather than change them. I am not sure if they are trying to conserve water or something, but we asked that they be fully changed and housekeeping quickly complied. Otherwise the room was kept very clean.",pos

Beds were comfortable and towels were plentiful and clean. Some things that might have been nice Plugs and/or usb ports for charging electronics.

"A lodging staple for budget-minded road-trippers and business travelers. In ShortSince the Ramada brand made its debut in 1954 in Flagstaff, Ariz., the hotel franchise has been offering dependable accommodations with budget-wise perks. Families appreciate the kids-stay-free policy for children 17 and under staying with their parents. Other amenities usually include a swimming pool, full-service restaurant, lounge, in-room data ports and voice mail. Group rates--for wedding parties, corporate groups or family reunions--are available for parties requiring 10 or more rooms per night.",neg

Front desk staff were extremely accommodating to my grandparents request for an accessible room near mine. Also one of very few hotels to accept cash payment without a credit card hold.

"Hotel was well below our expectations. We wanted to celebrate our anniversary at a nice hotel in Mallorca but it was subpar at best. Hotel is decorated with antique furniture which made the hotel and the rooms smell pretty bad. They also used this very heavy fragrance which made staying at all common areas, such as lobby or bars, quite unbearable. To make things worse, there was a post in the middle of the room which made moving around difficult in a small room. The hotel told us that we had to pay extra in order to change the room as that was the only room available for the price that we paid. One can probably find a much better hotel for the price you pay for this hotel. Service can certainly improve as well. Location is quite awkward as well. It's about 40 minute walk to the city centre and it's not close to the beaches either. Unfortunately, I don't have anything nice to say about this hotel.",neg

"This hotel was very run down, there were no towels in the room when we arrived and after requesting towels it took them almost 1 hour to bring them. Their response was they had no clean ones left and had to wash and dry before bringing. The floors/carpet were very dirty. The kitchenette was very old and moldy, plus the refridgerator was on but did not cool. I would not stay here again. And not easy to locate of the 410 loop, if you miss the exit that is more than a mile before the hotel you will end up traveling more than 5 miles round-about to get back. Very weirdly located. I think this was an old apartment complex and was made into a hotel/motel that needs alot of improvements inside and outside. The pictures that were used to describe the hotel must have been from another hotel, they did not vaguely look like the picture on on this website. BEWARE",neg

Some of the towels had marks on them that made us think they shouldn't be used anymore. The hotel guide in the room was not helpful at all. The tv guide in the room guide was completely wrong.

Despite major road construction at the exit off the parkway, we were able to find the hotel fine. The front desk attendant was very helpful in suggesting a restaurant that would deliver at the late hour we had arrived. He also showed us where the breakfast kitchen set up was but he didn't mention the amazing selection of food we had to choose from! Our room was very comfortable in size. The beds were very comfortable with soft and luxurious bedding! The bathroom was spa like! The adjustable massaging shower head was perfect to end the long day of driving! I hated to leave! If all LaQuintas are as nice as this one in Hopkinsville, I will never book anywhere else!",pos
"The hotel is awkwardly located on a corner and looks very worn out. The parking lot is small. Breakfast was cheap, cereal, fruit, and the usual. The office staff is okay. The room was just old and dirty looking. The place just needs to be gutted and redone desperately. I don't need modern and expensive but if a room is nearly triple digits in price, there is no reason for it to be this bad. Unfortunately we were stuck here 3 nights and did our best to wake up early, go out, and not come back till we were ready to walk in and crash. Sadly we had little choice as we had booked a room at the Crow's Peak Lodge and it was so bad and disgusting we couldn't even stomach to stay a night. The hotels in this entire area seem to take no pride in their craft and it definitely reflects poorly on the local populace. Western South Dakota as a whole was extremely overrated and not worth the money we spent.",neg

They also claim to be ""smoke free"" but they allow people to smoke right outside the door, with the door open. So being on the second floor the smoke went right up the stairs into our room. The room was also very drafty. We stayed in April, I can't imagine what it would have been like in January. All in all it was clean, but we wouldn't stay there again.",avg

"Had a late check in and had to register through a glass window while standing in the cold garage. That made me super skeptical. Got to my room and it was okay. Broken mirror, destroyed room phone, but other than that it got the job done. I honestly just didn't feel completely safe in the area. At 11p when I step out my room there were random young adults just hanging around the terrace. They were there when I left and when I returned. There was no security. Doubtful I'll return, but for the price, for some it'll get the job done. The online pictures and reviews are what I went by but had an entirely different feel and experience when I stayed.",avg

We stayed in the Pheasant Room for three nights and found it very pleasant. This is our second time staying at the Mt. Gardner and likely won't be our last. My only complaint would be how clearly we could hear the adjoining room use the restroom at 4:00am. But that was minor.,pos

"It's a motel. For 30 a night I wasn't expecting much. The owner is very friendly and so was the housekeeper. My biggest problem was the bed. It was hard as a rock. I literally woke up because my hip was sore from laying on my side. And the main office smells like some kind of musky oil and it just stayed with me the whole time. I didn't like it at all. I did like that it is a smoke free, pet free property. Here is a few ideas to make the place better. New beds, pillows and blankets, new paint in the rooms (get rid of those bold colors, no-one likes them in a bed room, not calming or relaxing) and stop with the oil or whatever that smell is and I would def stay again.",neg

I'm sure had Justin explained the situation, the couple would have switched. We had an outside room 28 right by construction on mason st. Loud and irratating!

It's located along a decently-sized and safe shopping/dining corridor, and I was pleasantly surprised that Starbucks is right across the street. Note: I reserved and paid in full through hotels.com but was asked for my credit card upon check-in, and an additional 75 hold was applied to my account and remained for one week...which seemed a little excessive to me, given that I was there for barely 12 hours. Maybe a week-long hold of 150 of the nightly room rate is standard for most hotels, and I've just never noticed before, but budget-conscious visitors might want to be aware of this. I was also charged a 10 pet fee, which wasn't advertised here, but that wasn't a huge deal.

However, after the visitation for my grandmother's funeral my cousins, aunts, uncle and I met up in the restaurant, and that's where the nightmare occurred.1.  I ordered gluten free because I have celiac, and the waitress put the order in for regular.  Fortunately, I figured it out before eating it.  When I received my gluten free burger I was completely underwhelmed.  Plus, I ordered it with bacon and didn't receive it.2.  Another order at our table was lost completely so it took over an hour for them to get their food.  When they complained to the manager he got hostile and did not make any amends.3.  It took over 1/2 hour for everyone to get their food even though we all ordered separately and at different times.4.  When food came the waitress gave the wrong orders to people.  She was very nice, but I wonder if she was new.5.  After that I saw the manager having a hissy fit at the front desk.  He was aggressively grabbing papers out of other staff's hands, raising his voice and glaring at me as I walked by.  I hadn't even spoken to him!  He made me very nervous.6.  It took well over 1/2 hour to pay with a credit card.  I'm assuming that the credit card machine in the restaurant was broken because I saw our waitress at the front desk running our cards.7.

"Very disappointed , hotel was being refurbished, the room we were given was like walking out onto a building site, went to ask to be moved very cold reception from the recepionist but did move us to the other side of the hotel, which wasn't really any better the workmen walking past with big trolleys full of building materials from early in the morning, breakfast was a shambles too, given paper plates the size of a small bowl and expected to carry (balance) it and walk up to the next floor to eat as there was no sufficient room to seat the guests ( only around 20 chairs to seat more than 300 rooms) we carried ours back to our room by the time we got there it was cold , the pool area was tiny, only having 2 loungers by its side and 2 chairs so there's no chance of sitting there to relax or get a tan, in all we were very disappointed we had to go out from early morning till late at night because it just wasn't relaxing to stay at the hotel , wouldn't recommend it at all",pos
"The first Non-Smoking room that I was assigned (106) wreaked of cigarettes, and there was to be a 250 cleaning fee assessed to any room with evidence of smoking. I asked for another room. The second room that I was assigned (241), was great. It was very clean, with a modern decor, and it had all of the basic amenities. The only other issue that I had with the property, regarded their policy on security deposits. Not refunding security deposits until after 9AM is a horrible policy. Most business travellers have to check-out well before then. Luckily, I was able to convince someone to work with me at 8:30AM, so that I didn't have to choose between missing my meeting (less than 10min away), or forfeiting a security deposit that I deserved back.",avg

Outside of that, our stay was very nice. The gentleman at the front desk was especially cordial and accommodating.",pos
No microwave in the room. The side access door wasn't secure. The handle on the door was missing therefore anyone could easily access the hotel from that side door.

"Where to begin....The first peculiar thing about this hotel is that two operations are within walking distance. Make sure that you check into the correct one. The next thing was the explanation at check-in that went something like this: There is no housekeeping so if you desire clean towels or sheets then return to the front desk with the used to exchange for clean. If you need a bar of soap or shampoo, please return to the front desk and request more. Please take the trash can from the room and walk down the hallway and find the sign and door marked Trash Room and empty it there. The room is outfitted with a cooktop and refrigerator but all dishes have been removed to ensure that they are clean. If you need dishes, coffee pot, etc please return to the front desk and request it.

The warmth, care and passion shown by Natalie and her team will always be remembered. On arrival there were flowers in our room as they had remembered we were in Sicily celebrating our wedding anniversary. Every evening they have canopies on the terrace overlooking stunning views. On our first night the drinks were complimentary. Breakfast was to die for incl the wonderful pastries and cakes, I have never eaten such delicious treats that just melted in your mouth. I couldn't resist. They also have the best freshly squeezed blood red orange juice my absolute favourite. We had room 304 on the very top level with the most stunning views. The outstanding service continued throughout our whole stay, whether it was booking us restaurants, taxis, giving advise on things to do, making sure we had towels when visiting the beach, recommending specific specialist shops when we showed interest in items we wanted to buy. Natalie and Olga day or night always took time to ask us how our day went and what our plans were and genuinely seemed interested in talking to us. We were not just guests we felt like friends.

This is the hotel we always stay at in Abilene. It is a little loud with the road noise being close to the highway and dumpster trucks early in the morning but I dont mind due to how clean it is.,pos
"Despite reservation, this hotel was overbooked. They sent me next door to quality in, which was a cheap suite with motel 6 feel. It felt unsafe, and unclean. Even with my best effort I could not locate another hotel. The next day I was able to go to Comfort in, but because of the area, and being bumped. I will never return.",pos
Stayed overnight for a little getaway and went to Dave and Busters. It was convenient for a Drs appointment I had the next morning in that area.,pos
"Older hotel. Furniture was upgraded, but bathroom was not. We just needed a decent place to stay for the night. The receptionist was very nice, and the place was clean. Our room did smell weird, but we brought Febreeze. Continental breakfast consisted of waffles and Danishes. We arrived at a late hour, We slept good, and we left early.",avg
"Great stay, with restaurant and sports bar in the hotel. The staff was friendly, and the room was great - with refrigerator and microwave. They even provided soft and firm pillows!The only downside of this hotel is that there is no elevator. However, they tell you this during check in and ask if you would prefer to be on the first floor.",pos
"Combination business and high school graduation. The only disappointment was no coffee service/equipment in the room and the machine in the lobby was a very long slow process. If they are going to do lobby only, they need to brew in larger volume and put out the pumps as so many other motels are doing across the country.",pos
Wouldn't necessarily recommend this hotel unless you need to stay somewhere cheap. You will definitely get what you are paying for though. Our room had the overwhelming smell of fresh paint. There was also a dirty diaper in the bottom of the swimming pool and we noticed it after we had been swimming in it for a little bit. The hot tub is really gross and dirty and needs a much needed scrubbing. The only good thing about this hotel is that it is quiet and the breakfast was decent.,neg
We were very pleased with our stay at Days Inn. We travel to and from Florida twice per year and we always stay here. Would recommend it to anyone who wants a good place to stay. The breakfast could be expanded a little. We have stayed in other Days Inns that have a much better breakfast choice.,pos

"Our two night stay was good! We arrived at 10pm. We were welcomed with a friendly front desk receptionist. Beds were comfy. Room was quite spacious, although needs to be updated. However, extremely clean. The only thing we delt with was our bathroom fan kinda had a mind of its own, it would come on and turn off when it wanted to, which wasn't a big deal for us at all. The room we were in was on the first floor facing the parking lot and three rooms away from the dinning area and it was super quiet! Even though we didn't use this feature, the hotel surprisingly had room service!! However, there is a Dennis restaurant right next door. It was a 5 Uber ride from Disneyland to the hotel.",pos
Not enough wash clothes. Bathtub drain dirty. Only one chair to sit down. Bed fairly comfortable.,avg

I visited with 2 dogs, and the staff were so helpful and even remembered my name every time I came in and out. The lobby, elevators, hallways, everything is all gorgeous. Really great designer. Check in/out was easy. Only problem I have with this hotel is that they charged me 164$ when I left. I haven't called yet to ask what this was for. I did park overnight for one night and I did use the internet for one day, but that doesn't seem to add up to almost 200$. That's the only reason I didn't rate 5 stars.",pos
"Wir buchten das Hotel fr 4 Nchte in der Woche vor Ostern. Der Aufenthalt war durchweg angenehm. Das Frhstcksbuffet war reichhaltig und frisch (allerdings rate ich von dem Rhrei ab). Wenn etwas aufgebraucht war, wurde es umgehend aufgefllt. Vom Frhstcksraum aus konnte man den Blick ber die Lagune genieen. Obwohl unser Zimmer im Erdgeschoss zur Nebenstrae hin lag, war es dort sehr ruhig. Die Einrichtung ist geschmackvoll und zweckmig. An Sauberkeit mangelte es nicht. Obwohl wir nicht den Anspruch stellten, wurden die Handtcher tglich gewechselt. Das einzige Manko war die Temperatur des Duschwassers. Es wechselte stndig von ziemlich kalt zu sehr hei. Erwhnenswert ist auch das Waschbecken. Der Wasserhahn ist ziemlich klein und so ber dem hervorstehenden berlauf angebracht, dass es schon schwierig ist, die Hnde darunter zu waschen. Der Empfang an der Rezeption war sehr freundlich. Leider war unser Koffer nicht mit uns angekommen. Die nette Empfangsdame kmmerte sich darum und hielt Kontakt mit dem Flughafen. Am nchsten Tag wurden wir vom Hotel aus benachrichtigt, dass unser Koffer nun da sei. Gleich in der Nhe des Hotels ist eine Bushaltestelle. Wir fuhren allerdings nie mit dem Bus, da der Weg zum Anleger fr die Wasserbusse nicht weit war. Das Warten auf den nchsten Bus htte mitunter lnger gedauert, als zu Fu zu dem Anleger zu gehen.",pos

"I've always loved Courtyard by Marriott, but it looks like time has eroded some of the little things that made it great. It is a nice hotel and a good hotel, but has lost sight that details matter. Cleaning carts block the hallways (literally), brooms are forgotten, little bits of debris are ignored, staff readily apologize but it is without sincerity, tables aren't wiped down and actually wobble, coffee cups aren't replaced in the rooms, the blanket is just shoved into the closet, the tissue box looks like it was partially emptied then restuffed, there's no info/brochure on amenities in the room, there is some litter around the landscape, a list of charges has to be requested instead of supplied.

"My wife and I stayed with these folks at the end of May - at first we weren't to sure. The building has a different feel to it. What I will say is 1.) amazing bar / restaurant 2.) the nicest people in the world! (I'm from Chicago, so...) 3.) an overall cool experience. We drove down the enchanted highway and stopped at each of the sculptures (I believe the first one off the expressway is in the Guinness book of world records for the largest sculpture of recycled / repurposed scrap). On day 1, we ate at the local pub (there's only 1, so you can't miss it). Once again - friendly folks, great cookin' (and cold beer!). We also toured the many historical buildings there onsite. Wonderfully warm folks - it makes me think how different the world would be if we all treated each other as nicely. So the bottom line - Regent and the Enchanted Castle get two thumbs up. If you're passing through that part of North Dakota, don't miss it.",pos

I had to stand out in the cold and wait till someone else came to check me in. Then that process a bit unorganized and the girl didn't give me my driver's license back and i didn't know it till the next morning at check out. and I only found out then because instead of leaving the keys in the room like I usually do I decided to go to the lobby and check out.

The trip was good overall but the complex is so big that taking a cart around was the only way to get anywhere. The carts should come around every 5 minutes but it was more like 20-30 minutes. When you first arrive they have a company that sells you cheaper excursions at a discount if you go to the property time share and what they don't tell you is you will still need to pay more fee's when you get to the excursion. Don't try to get a refund becuase they will pass you around from supervisiors to Managers.,avg

Our room was one of the cheaper basic rooms by Mandarin standard however it could be compared to other hotels absolute best offerings! Calling room service always had a personalised greeting (caller ID), inroom dining was fantastic for a late night feast with some fresh salad and berries, rooms are kept immaculately clean and you always have plenty of towels and extras. Dining at breakfast time was superb as well, we showed up 20 minutes before end of breakfast and they still accommodated us wonderfully in a stunning restaurant by the garden offering traditional indonesian, japanese and international cuisine all for the buffet price. Think - smoked salmon, crisp pastries, espresso machine coffee made just for you, and even fresh sushi and sashimi made to order. Checking out time was flexible and arranged perfectly so that we could leave our bags for an hour at the hotel which we did not expect after previous experiences.

This was available and paid for immediately on booking.When we got to the hotel after the allowed check-in time, we were told that they did not have that room available. We offered to stay in a 2 bed room, either double beds or queens. At this time one of the 2 girls at the counter proceeded to go to clean a room! We said just to give us a smoking king instead and we would make do with that. As we drove around the hotel to where our room was located, we noticed curtains hanging off windows in some rooms and others appeared that the lining may have been ripped away. We opened the door to the room and closed it again...it was very small, dirty and smelly !! We went back to the desk and said we could not stay there and requested our money back. They said that there was a no refund policy. I realized this when I booked but they were not able to deliver the room which I had paid for so should have made the exception because of this. We did not stay at the hotel but decided to continue on to another city to find accommodations. This is the first bad review that I have given a hotel.

"Awful, awful, awful!!! On our trip from FL to VT we had stayed at a Hampton the previous night and it was just exceptional, so we sought out another Hampton Inn along our trip. We were traveling with our 2 non-shedding very well behaved medium sized dogs and were told at check in that there would be a 75 pet fee per dog! There was no indication of this online at all. The check in clerk stated that they were having problems with dogs so just changed their policy to charge a fee, and she was nice enough to only charge us for one pet - 75.00. Are you kidding We were then put in one of the pet rooms which shared a wall with the elevator and that's exactly what we heard the entire night, the elevator going up and down. We asked to be moved but was told there are only so many pet friendly rooms and there were no other rooms available. Pet friendly You must mean pet tolerant since in no way was this hotel pet friendly. On top of that I could not get the room to cool off and the air conditioner made a horrible noise the entire night. What a change from the Hampton Inn in Columbia, SC that we stayed the night before, a real gem! I would never stay at this hotel again.",pos

"The room did not have a thermostat and the floor register could not close. The room was hot for the first two days and than no heat the last morning WiFi did not work the last morning The maid did not come in to clean the room, make the bed, nor provide new coffee packages. On check out it was noted that you had to put the sign out for maid service but no where was that posted The breakfast was not on site. They gave you a voucher for a restaurant a block away",neg
"Lived in this hotel for almost 3 months while transferring from NC. The staff was excellent, the suite was clean and well kept, the bed and pillows were very similar to the ones at home.

"This is a nice new hotel, and I enjoyed my stay. Only a couple of issues: there was no cooling function with the ac, so I had to open the window to chill the room. Also, the main sink was very slow to drain, which is annoying and gross.",pos
The only real problem encountered was the wifi would not stay up and useable. It was very erratic.,pos

Very convenient location. Staff was friendly. Neighborhood lacks charm but is a short walk to the the Duomo. Beds are very hard. Breakfast was rather good-nice outdoor patio to enjoy while eating. I recommend it based on our experience.,pos
"The front desk staff of Stephanie, Kathy and Matt were absolutely wonderful attending to our needs. Kathy got us a room for an extra night and was so helpful with the rates. Room was clean and comfortable. Very close to town so we were able to walk around. Highly recommend this hotel.",pos
"The first few minutes of entering any Hotel always sets the mood. The Ladies at the front desk were super friendly and helpful. That alone will bring me back. Add to that a comfortable room, a clean bathroom and most of all a clean, fresh, comfortable bed and all is well. But you did not ask me about the Restaurant.......that would definitely get a thumbs down. Thanks for letting me have my say. Ursula Raymondo",pos

Excellent spa services and great prices. We originally planned to stay one night but stayed for three. This is a gem!!!,pos

"We had to wait 1.5 hrs to check in. When we went back to the desk to get an update, our room still wasn't available so they put us in an ADA room which was fine. The rug on the balcony was lifted up. Hotels.com said the check out was at noon but the brochure in the room said 11am. Staff was knocking on our door at 1030 am even w do not disturb sign hanging. We did mention all this at check out and got some money off our stay which was helpful.",avg
"This hotel has not been updated since the eighties! The room for three was small and very dirty. The bathroom was really smelly and the shower mat was moldy! There are no windows or extractors to the bathroom, so the smells just linger! The air con is loud but just just doesn't cool the room. The room just felt dusty and carpets had lots of dirt and hair of the previous occupant. On arrival the receptionist was not friendly but just took our passport and lead us to our room, with no information about anything. When I asked when I would get my passports back, he gave some mumbled remark about return it in ten minutes after he had photocopied them. I had to ask for them later that day! Poor customer services. Other staff were equally bad, expect for the lady at breakfast who at least smiled and was attentive. Breakfast was good. You could boil your own eggs, cereal, cakes etc.",neg

The stay was overall good. The air condition in the rooms are motion-controlled or something. No matter where you set the thermostat. It never gets any colder. They were going to send somebody after maintenance to look at it. But it was 3 in the morning when we went to bed. Didn't want somebody in my room that late. The casino needs new chairs the ones they have are very uncomfortable. Trying to sit at a table for hours upon hours is hard to do. The bathrooms in the casino are located at each end makes it hard to get up and go to the bathroom from a table. Since the tables are in the middle of the casino. Poor design for bathrooms. But drinks were great my drink was never empty playing on the tables or at the slot machines. Which is extremely nice. Everybody was very friendly for the most part. I will stay again.,avg
"Enjoyed a long weekend with our family. Chose this hotel for its proximity to the Mall of America. Liked that it was in walking distance to the mall and had some dining choices nearby. The decor of the hotel is somewhat dated. We stayed on the 2nd floor which had convenient stair access to the lobby. We did make use of the pool a couple of times, but with two small children (5 and 7), we did find that the pool was a bit too deep for them, even in the shallow end. The free breakfast was decent. Overall we enjoyed our stay and would stay here again.",avg

First time in Columbus. Hotel staff friendly. Breakfast great. Not to happy to get a room with 2 doubles but it was still nice. No microwave. Entrance and exit to hotel need to be upgraded. Would recommend due to location and Kroger right next door.,pos
We stayed after the very busy Memorial Day Week end. The key card machine had broke due to the large number of patrons over the week end. The staff were very friendly and walked us to our rooms to open the door and were staffed for coming and going due to this unusual situation.,pos

Excellent facility and a very accommodating staff. Overall very clean and well kept. Location is excellent in the center of the city and near all restaurants and services. Very close access to I 75 for North or South travel,pos
"Short 3 night break to catch up with family and friends. Hotel staff very friendly and helpful, my wife is vegetarian and on the one night we ate at the hotel there was nothing on the bar menu she wanted to eat, waiters and chef went the extra mile to make a meal for her. Plenty of choice for breakfast.",pos

"Room was ok. Had updated bathroom and nice floor. But 1200 more in the room would of been great room. New stove microwave, cloth binds the one in room were broke off. Two old tvs. 180.00 dollar flat screens. Internet was week. But 80 dollors a night it was ok. If repairs were done we would gladly paid 100.00 to 125.00 a night. Just fyi.",pos

"Lovely hotel and the staff are fantastic. I called to try for a last minute reservation the morning of my check in. Spoke to by far the nicest man by the name of Howard. He was humorous, helpful and took my phone number down to call and let me know if I could check in early. I did manage to do an earlier check in and the entire front desk crew were incredible. Very lively pool area (loud but fun) and the rooms are delightful. Looks renovated, amazingly comfortable bed, I was on the 5th floor facing a quiet area, cute bathroom, clean and so convenient. Only thing I would have liked is a refrigerator as I'm used to the chains like Marriott and Hampton Inns etc., however, with a foodstore opposite and Starbucks plus other stores, it was no big deal. Will definitely stay there again. Will admit though that the direct rate booking through hotel website was cheaper than Expedia but it was too late, I had used Expedia for this booking.",pos
"I don't think there is anything standing out for this hotel. Hotel is clean furnishing is ok. breakfast is as usual. It has all the amenities as a regular Fairfield, no better and no worse.

The sound carries through that door as if they were in the same room with us. The door latch on the inside of the room did not work. Out of 5 pieces of equipment in the fitness center, only 1 piece worked. I have stayed in many Hampton Inn's in different states and have always been very pleased, but this stay was by far the worst!",avg

"Besides the foul/unusual smell in the hotel room and the unusually cold pool, this stay was great. We selected this hotel because we were traveling with a group of my daughter's friends and we knew the kids would be happy to have a pool to swim in. Well, so much for that, the kids could not even swim in the big pool because it was so cold. They moved to the hot tub and after a few minutes we had a bunch of blue lipped 4 year olds. The funky,sour, old vacuum cleaner bag smell in the room was enough to make me consider never using the Holiday Inn Express chain again!",neg
I was glad my stay was overnight. I would had checked out if not for that reason,neg
The service at the front desk and at breakfast was great from start to finish. We were especially impressed with how friendly everyone was. Even the guests were kind and polite to each other. It was a very enjoyable stay.,pos
Great hotel although I didn't feel that it was really downtown. The area of Boise that I would call downtown was almost a mile away.,pos

My room was very comfortable and clean. There are many businesses and restaurants conveniently in the area. I enjoyed my stay!",pos
"We were in town for a family funeral, not the happiest of times, but the hospitality of the staff helped immensely. The hotel was clean, newly remodeled, contemporary, and the room very nice and comfortable. There are higher priced hotels surrounding it but I doubt any of them could touch the LaQuinta for value and quality. I would definitely stay there again.",pos

However, the curtain was visibly stained. The cleaning crew did not clean the toilet the first day (it clogged, and still was when I returned in the evening). The capstone I got to watch a large, many legged bug 1.5 long scurry across the bathroom floor and out of sight. I then discovered another similar one behind the shower curtain on the floor dead next to the tub.",pos

When I arrived the front desk attendant was very unprofessional and did not want to answer any of my questions, but it was a long drive from Philadelphia so I just checked in and went to my room. To my utter disgust the room was dirty, outdated with broken light covers, the bathroom looked as if someone let some sort of liquid drip down the wall leaving stains, the bathroom fixtures were dirty and rusted, the tub was unclean, the towels were torn and tattered with holes and to top it all off the bed was so hard that I found myself sleeping in the chair and I have supporting photos to support my review.

"When we first looked at our room, it looked as expected. Clean, etc. When we used the bathroom however, I noticed that everything was very very low to the ground: toilet, shower sink counter--So much so that I had to bend my knees and strain my back to reach my hands under the faucet to wash my hands. Kind of annoying since standard counter height for bathrooms now is 36. This counter height was around 26-27 high so I was not happy with that part. Also, water pressure was very low--so that was also annoying. When I woke up---I had bites on my arm that weren't there the night before when I went to sleep. When I went to check out in the morning -- I told the hotel employees about this. The man behind the counter said that since I booked with Hotels.com, they weren't able to do anything compensatory like a discount, etc. First of all---I never asked for a discount or compensation. Besides, it's not a Hotels.com issue---it's a Best Western issue! Later the manager did call me and thanked me for letting them know. He said he would call me back after a thorough room inspection. He never did. Two days later, the bites are still there---but are now healing. I was grossed out and worried about bringing whatever that was back to my house! Also--breakfast was practically inedible. They were out of everything anyway because they were super crowded due to the end-of-breakfast stampede. Suggestion--extend the weekend breakfast hours or start later on the weekends.",neg
"We only stayed one night but I wish we could have stayed longer. The rooms were clean and newly updated, the staff was very friendly and helpful and my kids loved the pool and hot tubs.

We stayed at this hotel December 2012. The hotel was easy to find and was located on the same road as a Denny's and gas stations. The room very large and clean.

"This was an overnight stop on a cross country road trip and first time staying in a casino hotel. We didn't like the fact that the casino blocked our cell signal. Our family was unable to communicate with each other by text. Eventhough we stayed in the family tower, the hotel wasn't very kid friendly. My 13 year old complained about the cigarette smoke was amazed by the number of adults drinking liquor at the breakfast buffet. The buffet was also not a good family value and the food seemed old.

"We checked in to find out the wifi wasn't working, and then to find a dirty, buggy room waiting for us. Centipedes or similar on room floor, small black bugs in the bathroom, and ants in the kitchen. While the staff was extremely rude, including the manager who just walked off, they did clean the room and spray for us. When we wanted to try the wifi, which we were told had been out a few days and did work around the pool, we were given an incorrect passcode. When we asked for help because all but 3 or 4 of the tv stations were pixelating, the call to maintanence was the lady in room xyz is up here complaining about her tv, instead of the guests in room xyz need their to looked at. We were charged at check in, although told we would be charged at check out. We were told we couldn't get a receipt because the computers were down, and couldn't even be told what we were charged. When I complained, the customer service rep turned his head to the side and spoke in baby talk...I'm so sorry, It's not my fault. Overall, I would avoid this hotel. For the money, there are surrounding hotels that aren't filthy. Had we not insisted it been recleaned and bug sprayed, we would have been expected to sleep in that!",neg

Breakfast was simple but was enough to you until lunch,( we aren't too fussy and overlook the minor things. )The location is perfect which is why we keep coming back beach at the front and shopping shopping at the back!!

They did comp the parking but at the same time said that you should not believe the Internet and call the hotel to be sure... What Are you kidding Your not suppose to trust the people who sell the rooms Oh well, after that point everything was really terrific and great. The hotel was great. The breakfast there was great too - particularly a guy named Leo who works in the restaurant. He is terrific and not just to me and my family but to everyone as I watched him do his work. I would definitely stay there again.",pos
Arrived hoping for a double bed but was told there were ONLY 4 double beds in the hotel and they were taken. The food was terrible so we ate out most of the time. The beds were awful... We changed rooms but still the beds are comfortable. Also no heating so rooms were cold and the flooring was worse. Most of the guests were oap's so really not a place for the under 40's. Would suggest a new review rating be done.... 3* and that's pushing it.,avg
This is how bad it is: we had to jump up and scream to get service and check. My wife actually fell inside the restaurant and not a single employee / manager or anyone made an effort to help her or see if she was alright. This place was just a nightmare.,neg

Staff cleaned the pool daily, lifeguards really friendly v comfy sun beds.

That said, it was our first all inclusive experience, and it wouldn't surprise me if other places had worse food. The unlimited cocktails/drinks were excellent, staff were very attentive (if a little robotic) and there were plenty of pools/areas to enjoy. It was just a shame it poured with rain for so much of our stay! Would have been good to have some more common indoor areas so we weren't restricted to our room. Wifi is at additional cost which in 2013 I think is ridiculous. The spa, which appeared very new, was excellent.",avg
"Staff was VERY friendly and accommodating. They arranged for a bike delivery and pickup and allowed us to check in early. The hotel is very modern and clean. We had a view of the harbor on the 4th floor. Towels and fresh coffee cups were delivered every day. The room had a two cup coffee maker, which was very convenient. Everything about this room was as advertised. The pool/hot tub area were clean and easy to get to. The fitness center has modern workout equipment. This hotel was definitely worth the price of admission. Take a harbor view if you want to view the harbor, the Coronado Bridge and the Pt. Loma. Take the Marina view if you want to see the boats, the planes taking off from the airport and the sunset.",pos

But they offered us two rooms (at no additional cost), each with a queen size bed and a sleep sofa. That part was fine. However, one of the rooms had no soap, toilet paper, shampoo, trash can, and sheets,etc., for the sleep sofa. Before we left for dinner, we advised the front desk of this.

"We had a king suite. The actual bedroom part was not that big and I wish there was a more solid curtain on the door between the living room and bedroom. There's no privacy with a translucent curtain. Bathroom was a decent size, sink area was in the bedroom. The bathroom lacked towel racks. I do like staying here because it's a lil further from Disneyland. The restaurants aren't as inflated. If you're not staying at one of the Disney hotels or right across the street you're going to either catch a shuttle or take a Uber/Lyft which is what we did and worked out well.",pos

"The Drury was great, as usual. The only complaint I have is that the room smelled of smoke. Since neither of us smoke AND the hotel is supposed to be completely smoke-free, that wasn't pleasant (thank goodness, we always bring a can of febreeze). Thankfully, it wasn't over-powering. They did offer to come check it out, but I was more concerned with not getting charged for smoking in the room, which is why I brought it up to the front desk staff. The breakfast is nice and the evening kickback (baked potatoes, nachos, hot dogs, soups, salad, etc.) is nice, too. It's all free and it's good. The room was comfortable and it was quite large. We had a coupon for a free upgrade, otherwise, I'm sure the room wouldn't have been nearly so large. The view of downtown Columbus was great! We took quite a few pictures as the sun was setting and the buildings were lighting up. We definitely felt safe walking around. I would stay here again.",pos

As you guessed, it did not. We were both so very tired after traveling, we just went to bed instead of calling down and requesting a different room. We decided to just stay where we were and my husband managed ok. It was just that the clerk was so certain that he had given us a walk in shower.

The manger was belligerent and did not even offer to move me and I told her I could not sleep in a room and on sheets that smelled of marijuana. She said that was all they had and I told her I would have to leave then and she got an attitude with me saying I would have to pay for the full time and I said it was a night cancellation fee and I did not cancel the room you put me in smells of marijuana, the noise of drunk stoned patrons and the lack of AC in the room to get the smell out was just not acceptable.

"A lodging staple for budget-minded road-trippers and business travelers. In ShortSince the Ramada brand made its debut in 1954 in Flagstaff, Ariz., the hotel franchise has been offering dependable accommodations with budget-wise perks. Families appreciate the kids-stay-free policy for children 17 and under staying with their parents. Other amenities usually include a swimming pool, full-service restaurant, lounge, in-room data ports and voice mail. Group rates--for wedding parties, corporate groups or family reunions--are available for parties requiring 10 or more rooms per night.",neg

I enjoyed my stay and will probably be staying here a few more times throughout the year on my travels.

"A great old hotel in an historic location, convenient for shopping, dinning, and historic site visits. We were very impressed by the door staff, bellmen and desk staff. We were less impressed by the limited storage in our room (we stayed for a week), the lack of towel bars in the bath, and the chilly temps in the bathroom. Otherwise, the room was wonderful. We would be happy to stay there again in the future.I hate the trend toward duvets in place of blankets. It is nearly impossible to make the room cool enough at night to make the duvet usable. Without it's cover, of course, the sleeper is too cold to be comfortable. Hence, a night in bed is a constant process of pushing down and pulling up the duvet.The wine reception each afternoon is a very nice touch.",pos

The shower wasn't too clean, and I had a little trouble figuring out how to make the Murphy bed - top bottom sheets on the bed, comforter sandwiched between two sheets in the closet. Great view (9th floor). Seems like the high price should include breakfast, but I suppose the kitchen facilities (which I didn't need or use) prevent that.",pos

"We chose this hotel thinking the location was convenient. It was not for us. We checked in, found that the room was musty and the A/C was not working well at all. after unloading our vehicle and beginning to settle in for the night, as it was very late, the toilet also broke. We still did not complain and just wanted to sleep. As my husband got in the bed, he asked if it was wet. I first assumed the sheets were not completely dried prior to making the bed, but realized my side was dry. He then jumped out of the bed, smelt the bed, and found that it was wet with urine. He then had to shower, get dressed, and go downstairs to get us a new room at midnight. We had to move our tired children and all of our belongings to another room down the hall. The beds were not comfortable and the breakfast was not fresh. There was no apology or other effort made to remedy this disgusting situation on the part of the hotel staff. The next morning, I had to reenter the first room to look for something we left behind in our midnight move, and found that the staff had simply stripped the bed and laid a hairdryer on the mattress to dry it from the urine. There was no additional cleaning done to the mattress. I will never stay in another Sleep Inn.",neg

Room service, breakfast, was 30 min late and I had to call to remind them. Food was mediocre...clumpy grits, dry eggs, no complementary coffee service unless you go to the lobby.",avg

"At check-in, I asked for a room with 2 queen beds instead of 1 king, and they obliged. Though it was probably cuz I had booked through Hotels.com, there was no upcharge. The room was fine but the bathroom looked well used and kinda dirty. The bathroom faucet handle came off in my hand but I was able to put it back on. The refrigerator was great to have! We had to ask a maid for help with the AC. Turned out there was a remote you had to use to change the temp. But the AC also made a horrible racket so we couldn't leave it on during the night. The room got stuffy so we opened a window. Breakfast was sparse but there were awesome cinnamon rolls in plastic bags. Checkout was good and I told the desk attendant about the faucet and AC.",avg

"This is a budget hotel disguised as a country inn and suites. A/C didn't work, shower water pressure is barely there, left over wash rags hanging on the shower from the last guest, and a slight old hotel smell. Told the front desk person about it...she just sighed and said, ok...you'll get a receipt for your stay from Expedia. Then she went back to her business. They guy who checked us in the night before spent several minutes complaining about how Expedia was the worst vendor to use for registrations because they only pass on the guest name.",neg
"The facility was beautiful and the view from our balcony was amazing. The hotel staff were very friendly during check in. They upgraded our room to accommodate myself and my two children. I was a little disappointed that the rec center with the pool and splash pad were so far from the room. It was about a 5 minute drive into a residential neighborhood. It seems as if the hotel shares the rec center with the neighborhood next to the hotel. However, it was a very nice pool area and there weren't very many people. The pool furniture was very nice and there was a snack bar. Overall our stay was amazing!",pos

We stayed two nights and were disappointed after being out all day and returning to the room at about 11 pm on the second night, the room had not been cleaned, bed not made, and we had no clean towels. This is a 2.5 star facility, so I do not expect 5 star accommodations. Unfortunately, the hotel advertises inside their elevator clean sheetsevery night. Location is on the main highway and it has an Open 24-hour tire shop operating next door.",pos

Was gone for the night and that they were no more rooms available.after explaining to him that we could not leave our belongings because the was no lock he said that there are cameras.After several minutes of back and forth a room became available. Also on the first night the hot tub had brown scum on top of thewater,neg
Spent two nights and came away very impressed. Most fine hotels in Taormina have great sea views but Villa Carlotta ups the game by providing excellent friendly service-beginning with a warm welcome and property by managers followed by a glass of prosecco in their top floor dining room terrace along. Large and well appointed rooms and helpful staff. A stunning pool and garden area - although weather would not oblige. Would not take kids there (although there were several families on property) and caution those with mobility issues to beware as Villa Carlotta is a good walk uphill from the center of town. Bountiful breakfast on top floor terrace room. Will certainly return.,pos

The room was decent sized but I could not put my finger on what was weird when I entered. Then I figured in out, there was no artwork on the walls. Not a big deal but I felt like I was in an institution. Secondly, the floor was not very clean. I kept stepping on little rocks or pebbles (or toenails). The floor should have been vacuumed better. I am a fan of hotels that have nice tile or laminate hardwood floors because I can see if they have been cleaned. Lastly, NO PARKING! You either pay 10 for valet or park in a garage. This is Battle Creek, not downtown Chicago. Provide some parking or at least validate the parking garage.",avg

"The building were we stayed was very out dated. The room was dirty and did not get cleaned appropriately, the beds got made while we were out but that was it. The tub faucet would unscrew when you attempted to use the shower and the tub would fill up as you took a shower. Water pipes broke at some point during our stay and they did not have the courtesy to come and tell us. When we figured this out I went to the front desk to ask for a different room and was told it would be fixed within the hour. Again, no one bothered to tell us when it was fixed. I felt that should have been a common courtesy. Black particles would blow in our room from the swamp cooler. The room was every dirty and although it was close to the beach it was not worth it. We actually left a day early from Marathon due to this facility.",neg

There was a birthday party at the pool at 7:30 at night for a pre-teen boy. It was very loud and the pool area smelled horrible. Then to top it all off the bed was horribly uncomfortable.",neg
The front desk was great but the cleaning crew was horrible . When we first checked in the room wasn't ready . It was just after 3PM so we decided to come back at around 8:30PM. When we went to the room the linen was full of hair. We called the front desk and they were very accommodating and gave us a new set but at this point we were very disappointed . The hotel is also only 3 floors and it took what felt like forever for the elevator to come. Over 10 minute waiting time on average . They don't have any other elevators and were transporting the garbage on the same elevators as the guests which stunk the elevator up like a garbage disposal. When we needed to get any dinnerware we had to ask at the front desk because the room had none and we had to wait for it to be washed because apparently they don't have any clean ones readily available. We will not be staying at this extended stay hotel ever ! It's sad because the front desk staff was extremely nice as well.,neg

The bed was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in (and I have a Tempurpedic at home)! The kids loved the arcade (prob not as much as my husband and I did once we put them to sleep).

Other choices were biscuits, plain gravy, dry cereal (milk), juice, apples, toast, cake donuts, bagels. CARB overload.",pos
"Clean. I didn't see any bugs or other health issues. Plenty of hot water. Very old hotel that needs updating. Breakfast area is under construction so the protein-less morning offering in the lobby of two pump carafes for coffee, a pitcher of orange drink (Tang) and bulk-bought pile of honey buns doesn't count as breakfast. I should get a partial refund.",neg

"Not staying here again. We arrived very late at night so made do, but were not happy with our stay. The linens on one of the beds were used and dirty, had not been replaced. There were lots of maintenance issues in the room, holes in the walls, missing fiextures etc. The staff was rude, the desk clerk was very short, and discurteous at checkout, and a member of the cleaning staff was extreamly rude. As we were leaving our room, she cut my wife and son off, telling them to, and i quote, move. The breakfast was horrible as well. Theye were out of several things, the waffless they prepared for the guests were overcooked, and the milk was either old, tainted, or there was something altering the taste in the dispense, it was inedible. We will never stay here again.",neg

Little did we know that a good night's rest would not be happening. As we opened the sofa bed we encountered a good amount of bugs crawling on the mattress. It was easy to see the bugs because of the white sheets. They were definately, without a doubt, bed bugs! Disgusting to say the least. That was where my twin 4yr old girls were going to sleep! Not a chance that was going to happen now! I went to the front desk and they told me the hotel was booked so nothing else was available. I didn't want to stay there period but my girls were so exhausted we all were! It was really late at night too. I was told I would get a discount only after I had asked how would I be compensated for this terrible experience. I still have not received any communication as to when that would happen. This has made me reevaluate the Hyatt standards for sure. This experience was horrible.",neg

Pillows were really tiny.. only 4 on king size bed for 2 people. Asked for 2 more and received them. But they go flat longer you lay on them. They must be trying to save using those little pillows but comfort is not something that should be cut back on in a hotel. That is what customer is paying for. Should at least go back to standard size. Thank you.,avg

There is a very impressive pool area with giant slide, but I did not use it. Several others seemed to enjoy it though. It is marketed as an indoor water park, and it is certainly to the closest thing to a water park in the area. Galena is cute and small, albeit somewhat lacking for a city slicker like me. However, I really love staying in these areas. Service is friendly and basic, and breakfast is a hot buffet with plenty of coffee. Couldn't ask for more at the price.",pos

The first morning eggs were offered but none left 1/2 hr prior to buffet closing. The second morning was sausage gravy - not loved by everyone and certainly about as unhealthy of an offering one could find. Hard boiled eggs were hard as rocks.",pos
Overall a good stay but was a little disconcerted when I went to my room and found another guest's belongings in it. I was just glad that the other guests weren't in the room when I walked in. The second room was comfortable (and unoccupied.),avg

Small pool, but perfect for ending a long day, and the hot tubs were perfect. Great pool towels! I was surprised that they were the same as the room towels. The only thing that wasn't that great was the pillow situation. Very flat. Make sure you bring your own, or be prepared to ask for additional. 2 per Queen Size bed.",pos

Needed somewhere to stay for a last minute business trip. Budge was right but condition of the hotel not. My room had a funny sewer smell in it when you ran the shower. The first night I couldn't figure it out and finally found a large drain in the floor directly behind the toilet that was the culprit. Every day I came back in my room the maid had firmly shut the bathroom door and every day I would open it and get almost knocked out of from the smell. The soap and shampoos where horrible smelling and I had to use three of them just to get a decent shower in. The gym in the hotel shouldn't be called a gym it should be a broom closet with an overstuffed treadmill bursting to escape. Had to go to the gym down the road to get a decent work out in. The night person in charge of the desk was sleeping in the lobby couch with all of the lights off every morning.,neg

We tried to ignore the noise but after midnight, my wife asked the group to keep the noise down. They got louder. After two more tries, we contacted the front desk.

When my wife opened the door to complain, they started to push her around. As soon as I stepped out of the door to help my wife, I was beaten by this drunken mob as my children in the room were terrified. My eye glasses were punched into my face causing me to bleed profusely. I was beaten and kicked as I lay on the hallway floor. My wife also has bruises all over her body. A couple across the hall called the police, but the damage was already done. When the police arrived, the attackers scattered. Some were in rooms on our floor while others were not even guests of the hotel. There are no cameras, no security and a night manager who would rather not get involved. The management told me that there was nothing that they can do because they have no way of knowing who was at fault. Unbelievable. My face is cut up, my wife is bruised and my children are traumatized. Good place if you want to party all night long. Bad place to bring a family.

The maid service was terrific and the best part for us was the free parking. We used our car a lot!! The 2 biggest negative's were the Wifi. ( it was basically nonexistent) We had to upgrade our plan twice through verizon but ended up with 6 free gigs/mo through a promotion we were told about when we called in route to Yosemite! And the other potential negative was the quality of the windows. There were nights we could hear the wind howling and the noise from the street but I'm not a light sleeper so it didn't bother me. (Just bring ear plugs in case you can't sleep from the outside noise). Oh and if you keep walking up Lombard Street from the hotel (1.5 miles approx.) you'll come across the famous crookedest St on Lombard St. !! It's hilly but worth the challenge!

"the hotel owners do not care about the hotel or the people staying there. the building needs a lot of work. the room is dingy, dirty and all the items inside are old and/broken. the room they gave us had a decent lock design, but the frame and door did not match so there was a large gap around the door. the AC unit was coming out of the wall, the appliances are old and dirty(no light in the fridge, frost in about 1/5 of the freezer, blow dryer didn't work due to a bad plug), bulb missing from the lamp in the living area and the ice machine in the hall doesn't work. the cleaning and maintenance crew consisted of older people who did enough to get by. we never received fresh towels or someone to come clean out the room. when the lights went out in the bathroom, it took 3 hours to get someone to come by. instead of bring a bulb, he came, took the burnt bulb and then came back again 10minutes later. Internet was pretty much nonexistence in the room. they kept saying that they have to reboot the router, but after a day of trying, they blamed it on time warner. the internet in the lobby area was great though, but that's not where i want to spend my time working. the pictures on Expedia are probably a few years old. we only used the room as a drop off point for our stuff as we were out most of the time, so if you don't plan on ""staying"" in the hotel, it's ok. still would have liked fresh towels. if i knew i could upload pictures on my review, i would have taken some.",neg

"This is by far the BEST hotel we have ever visited. The Inn was built in 1928 as apartments and has been transformed into efficiency rooms. When you enter the lobby you will see lovely lighting fixtures and a decor that takes you back in time. Our room is HUGE. We have a separate kitchen with table, fridge, stove, microwave, utensils and pans. Huge walk-in closet and modern bathroom. A ceiling fan and AC kept us nice and cool. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. I love that you use an actual key to get in your room. You also get a key for the front door if you come back late at night. The bed has a pillowtop and comfy pillows. The Inn is within walking distance of the Space Needle and only a block away from Seattle Center. There is a great diversity of restaurants, coffee bars, shopping and bars all around. I have stayed in 4-star hotels and they don't compare to the Inn. We have found our go-to home in Seattle!!",pos

I stayed in a superior room with a king sized bed. The room was very clean and well put-together. I enjoyed having my own sink mini refrigerator and microwave in my room. Talk about convenience! I also enjoyed a few little thoughtful amenities they had around the room like ear plugs and a female's makeup Necessities like makeup remover cotton swabs and cotton balls. Very cute idea! At night, the hotel was quiet and I felt very safe in this area. I would definitely stay here again.",avg

I have a high tolerance for bad hotels, but this place got the best of me, it is dirty, noisy, and very rundown to the point of very uncomfortable, people just hanging around on the stairs, in the halls, parking lot. The worse bed I have ever seen in a hotel room, there was no cold water in shower, so I had to fill the tube with hot water and let it cool, one towel in the room.

We felt safe. We didn't get to the hotel until nearly midnight, yet we still had a place to park right in front of our door. The only thing that would have made a perfect 5 stars is if the mattress was more comfortable. It was a little lumpy for my taste! Overall, a great place to stay, especially for the price!

The pool area also was dirty with cigarette buds and little pieces of garbage in the planter areas. The property was quiet at night for the most part.The staff was very nice.

The website hotels.com list descriptions of cerain amentities is misleading. There is an airport shuttle but you need to pay for it and it can cost 200 Euros each way.

Problem with air conditioning that was not fixed even when we left. Staff friendly and helpful but no manager ever available.

"We chose this hotel for the price and the location close to the Sawgrass Mall, both met our expectation. The room was spacious, bed was comfortable. Didn't have business center, however I got my boarding pass printed out by emailing it to the front desk, so that didn't matter much. We stayed in Room314, and it smelled like a smoking room. That bothered me a little. But other than that, We enjoyed our stay.",pos

They put us in a room above the check in area. It is basically an attic converted to look like another hotel room. The make shift double doors to enter should have been my first clue. The AC got the room cold for about 30 minutes and then it did not work again. It was actually cooler outside in the middle of July than it was in the room. Dingy and smelled. I will never stay there again.,neg

"This is a strange set up. The motel parking lot is in horrible shape and the first building you come to is deserted. There is no lobby or on-site staff. There are just a handful of rooms and they all have electronic keypads. Your code is emailed to you and is valid only during the times you've paid for. We paid for the king kitchenette suite. It had been decorated fairly nicely in a modern cabin kind of way, with a flat screen tv, fridge, stove and dining area. It could have been very acceptable but it was not clean! The floors were dirty, the bathroom had been stocked with clean towels, but the sink, bathtub, and floor looked as if it had not been cleaned at all between uses. There was a rug in front of the vanity that was just filthy, grungy, disgusting. Since there was no on site staff, we didn't bother complaining, we just there for one night. The up side was that the bed was comfortable and the air conditioner worked great. It's motel is sorely needed in this area, but please--hire a better cleaning crew or this place won't last!",neg

The front desk person unfortunately had a runny nose and instead of excusing herself to blow her nose just sniffled and wiped it with her hand and proceeded to work on computer, paperwork and room keys. 3. Handed us rooms keys for rooms that had yet to be cleaned. 4. Breakfast area had not been cleaned and at 7:30pm, had to ask for a rag and cleaner to clean ourselves. Floor was disgustingly dirty. 5. No washcloths or linens for pull out bed. 6. Coffee maker broken, pieces left sitting on the tray. This has to be the worst hotel experience I've ever had.",neg

When I ask for a taxi to the airport they told me I had to buy a ticket them, they charge me 135.00. When I gave the ticket to the taxi driver he told me the hotel pays him 75.00. And also told me that no ticket needed, the hotel is a big scam non stop. Beware of this place. I also notice they scam other people non stop. I will never return to this place. The beds are hard and the pillows are cheap. The pools are falling apart and very dirty. Sometimes it takes 45 minutes to get a ride. I'm very unhappy.

"We could NOT have asked for a better hotel for our 5 night stay in Paris. Upon arrival, we were greeted so warmly. We splurged on this trip, and got a superior room with a private terrace. I would HIGHLY recommend this room. We absolutely loved sitting out on the terrace - even though the weather was less than ideal for April/May. We still took full advantage. The room was small, but that is the European way! We were expecting a smaller room than we are used to in the States, so I actually thought it was bigger than I was envisioning it to be. It was a bit odd that the toilet was separate from the shower and sink, but worked well for us as a couple. We both thought the king size bed was so comfortable! Some added bonuses to the room: Loved the waterfall shower, loved the lighting (reading light on each side of bed controlled by a switch right above the bed), there are speakers for the TV in the shower/sink room so could listen to news as I was getting ready, and the towel warmer was also a plus! The included breakfast buffet each morning was also an unexpected luxury! We didn't think we had included breakfast, and it was an amazing spread! It was pretty much the same each morning, but we never went hungry... The entire staff were all so helpful and attentive. Always greeting with a smile and hello, and always willing to give directions or guidance on what to do or where to go.

"First the positives: Casino and Buffet staff were very friendly and rooms were a good deal for the price....so it seemed. Negatives: No a/c in the elevators and each tower only has one and we were on the 17th floor that stops almost every floor...not good when it's 115 degrees. We have watercrafts and there is very little parking...sometimes had to wait till people left to park. Room A/C worked but not well. The price of 39 a night seemed good but once you get home they add another 11 resort fee that wasn't disclosed. Lastly, we ordered a coffee maker that was great for the first day but not refilled after that. We even called down to get more coffee three times and it never came so I finally walked down and bought some at the Starbucks.

"I stayed at the Best Western Luxury Hotel on November 4, 2010. I lodged a complaint about broken furniture that might have caused me an injury. The owner implied that perhaps I broke the furniture. It was a sofa bed in the front room of the suite. I was charged 120.00 for the suite. When I checked in, I was told there was wet bar. When I got in the room, there was nothing, but an empty refrigerator and cabinets, which is not the definition of a hotel wet bar. When I sat on the bed, ...view morethe frame broke. When I tried to get out, it broke again. My roommate had to come and help me get out of thebed. Then the bed could not be put back in the couch. I have had a hip replacement. Sitting on that sofa bed with a broken frame that fell in could have caused damage to my hip. And, that was not all the curtains in the room were too short to cover the entire window so there was light in the room all night. The last straw was that the room had a hair dryer that would not stay on while in use. I had to hold the on button to use the dryer, which made it totally useless. Our stay was not a good experience. I have stayed in Best Western Hotels all over the US and never used one with this many problems. When I asked for a reduction in my charge, I was given only a 20, instead of a no charge for the room. I would not have been so disgruntled had the owner, Sarah Patel, given me a free night, but she did not. The hotel furniture was dangerous, did not have the wet bar that it promised, and did not have appropriate window coverings. Sarah Patel, owner of the establishment, provided (1) poor services, (2) unsafe equipment and (3) inoperable appliances. Her business tarnishes the image of Best Western Hotel International and the city of Tracy.view less",neg

There is public parking a couple blocks away that costs 6/day, but the valet was 10/day. Which I was cool with, but there was only one valet attendant. We stood there for awhile until I finally went in to ask to get my car parked. When we checked out, they had no idea where the keys were. I had to go into the key room and find my keys. So, yeah might wanna fine tune that process. Other than that, it was as good as it could of been for what we paid for. We had breakfast down in the restaurant which took about 30- 40 min to get our food. There was only 1 waitress working. She did as good as 1 person could do. We felt bad for her.

While there I hD to call severL times to contact front desk. The first room had ants so the switched us to a room facing the street however this room's bathroom had not been cleaned and the screen on the window had been sliced open which left me fearful all night.Finally the msid entered our room the next morning without knocking stating we were to check out,It was 9am.This motel was terribly misrepresented on.your site. No spa, salon, or gift shop on the premises. They were in walking distance but in a really bad neighborhood. I travel frequently and I am very disappointed in your web site, and The Quality Inn.",neg

We told her we had not checked out yet, as it was 2 hours before we needed to check out, and had not even taken all of our things out of the room yet. She did leave but stood outside the room for a while. I talked to the person at the front desk but they did not seem too concerned about it. Otherwise, the breakfast was great, the pool and hot tub were nice, the area was good, and the rest of the hotel looked pretty good as well.",pos

Our room was above average- smelled clean, was large enough to put up a pack in play. The breakfast in the morning is one of the best- a little bit of everything and constantly replenished. Only three stars for comfort because we could hear the kids in the room next to us through the wall and the neighborhood is your standard near the highway strip of chain hotels.",pos

"If I have the choice we would not stay here again. It works for your needs, but for the price you pay in the summer season, you are getting ripped off in my opinion. The beds were comfortable, but the room we had with a kitchen and a small table etc. I would expect that when you book the room they would tell you that their kitchen comes with basic supplies (pots/silverare/stuff to cook with) It DOES NOT. How are you supposed to cook anything without having something to cook it in! Hotel if is serious need of remodeling. It worked out fine, but on a scale of 1-10 I would only rate them a 5. Staff were great though, and they have a little play area for young kids there. I'm just upset I didn't go with something nicer for a few more bucks. Booked this months before we went. :(",neg

Hot food in the evening included hot dogs and chili.",pos

Odd entrance to elevator from the shared parking lot. Parking garage was filled with furniture being worked on. Halls had carts and garbage bags (laundry bags) left out for hours. 6 CHARGE ADDED TO MY BILL FOR PARKING. NEVER MENTIONED IN ADVANCE. OPEN SHARED PARKING LOT SHOULD NOT BE AN EXTRA FEE. RIDICULOUS IN WESTERN COLORADO. Clerk did remove the charge but I probably won't come again even though the room itself and the breakfast and the staff were all first rate. Paid parking is a deal breaker.,avg

We were there for a wedding and the reception was held in the Hotels facilities.  A courtyard was utilized for appetizers and drinks before the reception.  Service was excellent, the appetizers were tasty and readily available.  The reception meal was very well done, food excellent and service very good.  A breakfast was held in the morning and it was a disaster.  The service was terrible, items ordered never delivered.  Waited an hour before getting two cups of tea, served piecemeal; first I got my pot, minutes later my wife got her pot, and 10 minutes later we got our tea bags.  We waited an hour between our order and the time it was served and my wife never got her toast for her eggs.  The manager came round and apologized for the poor service and said they were just overwhelmed.  With 10 years of experience in Hotel dining rooms and myself serving 12 tables for 3 meals every day as well as being the head waiter; I cannot imagine why everything else was so great and this meal such a disaster.",pos

I often stay in 30 - 40/night places that leave plenty to be desired, and I've never once left a bad review or complained to the staff. I fully realize that you get what you pay for. However, this place is the worst I've ever stayed, bar none. The outside of the hotel was filthy. Feral cats and trash everywhere. The lobby was filthy. The room was filthy. Looking behind the bed for an outlet to plug my phone in, it was clear that no one had vacuumed under the bed in a very long time....it wasn't just dusty, it was gross. The carpet, bed skirt, and couch were all badly stained. The couch stunk like a combination of mold, cigarette smoke (even though this was a nonsmoking room), and sweat, making the whole room stink. The counter outside the bathroom was damaged. The bathtub had small hairs in it.",neg

We drove down the enchanted highway and stopped at each of the sculptures (I believe the first one off the expressway is in the Guinness book of world records for the largest sculpture of recycled /...view more repurposed scrap). On day 1, we ate at the local pub (there's only 1, so you can't miss it). Once again - friendly folks, great cookin' (and cold beer!). We also toured the many historical buildings there onsite.

"Impressive Front Desk Service!!! I am in a transition period in my life right now... I am in the process of moving and between where I used to live and where I am moving into, I needed a place to stay. Obviously money is an issue right now and there are the obvious costs with moving. I was and still am stressed out. On New Year's Eve, I was tired stressed, lonely, and frustrated. After bouncing around the whole city to find the right accomodation, I stumbled upon Discovery Inn. When it was my turn to get a room. I was blown away at how Kim, who was working the front desk was attentive and caring right off the bat. She noticed how tired I was and she first of all, made every effort to cheer me up and made me smile. She then reassured me about the amenities and about the hotel and how to best utilize everything. This was the beginning of a good, relaxing night. Even the occasional follow up was greatly appreciated. I have traveled all over this country on business and personal vacations. I have never received service where someone like Kim would take notice and reach out to make my day better and understand my needs and match the product accordingly. I am in sales and have been for a long time. Its always a good feeling when someone actually listens to you and understands your needs. This stay has been very enjoyable. I want to send a special shout out to Kim for her customer service. It goes a long way, and it has for me. Thank you and I hope those reading this will have a similar experience.",pos

The next 2 hours I tried to focus on work over the smell of food cooking and trains honking near building. It was a long day for me and I needed rest for an important meeting the next morning. Not to take a chance I asked the front desk if I could cancel and get a refund. She was very nice, professional and acknowledged that it was a loud night for the trains. Offered me a room on the other side of the building, but this would put me a stones throw from the highway. Considering I was already short on rest and needed to be on my best for next morning meeting, that was not an option. The Holiday Inn front desk told me there was nothing they could do because I booked my room through Hotels.com. I contacted Hotels.com and they told me there was nothing they could do because the hotel already had my money. This is the part of the story that really got me upset. Someone is lying and neither side took any steps to improve the situation, just passing it to the other party. I've happily used Hotels.com over the years and will not again.

After we complained we were put in another room, the maid made sure mostly things were clean. Put a sheet over the chair and didn't look at it.",neg

"The room was surprisingly large and 'suite-like' - a combination living room/mini kitchen area with couch, fridge, sink and microwave and a corner table and chairs. There was a flat screen TV in this room and a larger flat screen in the separate, king bed room. Sliding doors separate the living areas (including the bathroom) from the sleeping area.

The room was dirty, the curtains had holes, there wasn't any toilet paper or soap or shampoo. There were only three towels for 4 people. When I checked in, the desk clerk was more interested in talking on the phone or paying for his pizza that showed up after I had been standing there for a few minutes. Our phone in the room didn't work, so when we used our cell phone to call the front desk to get some toilet paper, the desk clerk acted like we were inconveniencing him. There was a train going all night. We decided to cut our stay short, and when I went to checkout, I had to wait 5 minutes for someone to help me, when no one showed up, I had to call the hotel to get someone to come down.

If you want a quiet room get one on the side opposite the freeway and away from the outside doors (this is a nonsmoking facility and smokers have to go outside to smoke), and particularly NOT on the ground floor.

"We booked our room on hotels.com and the picture on the site did not match the room we received. We paid quite a lot and was not informed that you need to request a room with a view in your booking, otherwise you will be placed in a room with a view of rooftops. We went down to the front desk and were relocated for an extra 120 euros a night to a nice room on the Regina side with a terrace overlooking the Grand Canal and Cathedral Salutta. The next morning, we were abruptly awakened by drilling and hammering at 7:30 am NOT the sleeping in we wanted so we asked for the manager to see what was going on. Antonelli could not have been MORE accommodating! Not only did he move us to a bigger room in the Europa building (picture what hotels.com ACTUALLY uses to promote the hotel, chandelier, 16 foot ceilings, 2nd floor stand-up balconies overlooking the gondolas) but he also removed the 120 euro surcharge and comped us breakfast. We were impressed. The next morning we were woken up - AGAIN by hammering at 7:30 am! OY! We visited the front desk again and spoke to a different manager, who was equally as apologetic. He comped us another breakfast and lunch in their beautiful restaurant. The hotel is 400 years old, so there is always something to be fixed. The property was clean, very Venetian and the Westin beds didn't disappoint. The location is great, in the high-end shopping district. We would stay there again due to the excellent customer service we received.",pos
"I booked this hotel based on its convenience and the fact that it was pet friendly, but was not up to par with others in the chain nor the quality for the price. The front desk was small, the hotel was recently renovated but it dd not appear to be and smelled smokey. The most disappointing part of my stay was when I realized the comforter on my bed was stained and dirty, what appeared to be an old pet accident stain accompanied by dirty marks. I was in a pet friendly room, however I expected it to be clean. Otherwise, the room was ok, could have been cleaner, floor in the tub felt unsteady and ceiling had questionable spots. Also the tv reception faded in and out and on my second night completely cut out and never returned. Breakfast was free but not worth the time it took to get downstairs. The first morning was ok, as they offered hard boiled eggs and fresh fruit. Morning 2 was only waffles, cold cereal and toast. No healthy options for those of us uninterested in a processed breakfast. The staff was friendly, location and parking was good, and I liked the fact that they don't charge additional fees for pets. They did accidentally place a 200 hold onto my credit card, which I questioned at the front desk upon checkout and was told it was a mistake by another employee. Overall, I had reservations about this hotel based on other reviews I read before booking but figured I would give it a try since it has undergone a recent reno.

They had a boogie board for my son to use that really made his time at the beach extra fun. They also had beach chairs and towels. Our room had character, not just a run of the mill hotel room and the grounds were beautiful. If we go back to Coronado we will definitely stay at the Cherokee Lodge.",pos

First off let me start by saying DONT WAIST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on tgis place..No im not over exaggerating..Im speaking the honest truth..My suite door look like it had been kicked in before, one of my beds were literally half way on the ground, the rails were broken, my sheets on the other bed hadnt been washed and stains. The fridge look like they found it in the dumpster, the room phone had no buttons to dail out.. So I called the front desk to let them know I cant stay hete with my family.. This arrogant worker that works at night was telling me she had no more rooms available so I went dont to talk with her and explained that Im not gonna pay to sleep here..then all of a sudden she gave me 2 other rooms to look at, they werent any better. When I got back she stated.that.she.called.the manager and offered me a refund. .we end up getting half of.the money refunded and checked.in at Days Inn which I felt it was well worth the money....BUT this hotel couldnt offer me a 10 day stay for free....ITS THAT BAD..NEVER EVER AGAIN!!!",neg

"We enjoyed our stay very much over the 4th of July weekend. Great rates for what you receive. The hotel location was convenient being right next to the highway and also being only about 15 minute walk to the beach. We left our car at the hotel our whole stay and walked everywhere. It was easier than finding parking by the beach. Room was clean and beds were very comfortable. Showers were great and always had the right temperature, even after all 4 of us showered. Complimentary breakfast was great and so convenient for my family of 4 and saved us some money eating at the hotel. Hotel property was clean and pretty. There are no views of the beach from our floor level but honestly, we didn't hang at the room expect to sleep and get ready for the days activities so that wasn't a priority to us. Would definitely stay here again.",pos

They needed better lighting but overall, very good experience. We would stay there again.",pos
Loved the hotel and staff. Great setting. We decided to just stay there for a swim and dinner and breakfast the next morning. It's the kind of hotel that has robes for guests (plus two different styles of slippers!). Nice soaps. Beautiful setting. A little close to the road so you do get some road noise. And the gym is pretty stripped down. But a great place for a day or two or relaxation!,pos

"I had stayed at the Sportsmen's Lodge 30+ years ago, and was surprised to see the online photos of what looked to be a complete makeover - but don't believe it. It is no more than a tired old motel with some new paint and a few accessories. The air conditioning didn't work, so we had to leave the sliding glass door open all night - first floor on the parking lot, so we slept with one eye open, since the neighborhood is a bit sketchy. We already moved rooms once, and were told that the room we had was the last of it's kind (with 2 queen beds) so we were stuck there. There was dried urine on the floor of the bathroom, and someone else's toothbrushes left on a shelf - I had to trust that they actually changed the sheets, but not sure about that. Finally, one of the guests next door was vomiting on the balcony in the middle of the night - so we finally realized that this is a motel for people who want to party all night - probably good for that, but not much else. Definitely not worth the high price we paid.",neg

We are not picky, and not 'clean freaks', but when your feet pick up not only dirt, but dust bunnies....just saying! The frustrating thing about it, was that the office staff did not apologize to us. We get that things get overlooked, but you do need to acknowledge the situation and try to make it right. No one did.",avg

"My wife and I are frequent visitors to the Disney parks and have stayed at 9 different hotels in the neighborhood, varying from 3 1/2 star hotels across the street to 2 star hotels a good distance away. Overall, this hotel is our absolute favorite place to be when we visit Disney. It is a slightly longer walk (20-25 minutes) than most people would like, but the value added here is definitely worth an extra ten minutes of walking. First, the service here is wonderful. The front desk is always very helpful and willing to accommodate requests. They also have free parking and free breakfast, and the breakfast actually has options and enough food to cover an entire meal. It is not a grab and go style to gives you a mini muffin and cup of coffee, but actually allows you and your family a free meal that also helps with budgeting trips. Also, we have always enjoyed the rooms and never had an issue with cleanliness. The beds are comfy and the in-room mini fridge and coffee makers are great. It is a little noisy, but simply leaving the fan on gives enough white noise to be able to sleep. To anyone looking for a budget friendly option that is still close enough to the parks that you can walk every day, this is definitely worth checking out!",pos

"This BNB turned out to be absolutely perfect for our romantic getaway and Bday celebration! The rooms aren't anything to brag about size wise but, they more than makeup for that in the buildings quaint atmosphere and low price.

"I made reservation for suite room, hopping we got seperate room, king bed in the bedroom and sleep sofa in the other room. But instead, I got king size bed and sleep sofa in on small room. I call to front counter, she explained to me nicely, the room that I have is the suite because it has mini kitchen, include range, sink, dish waher, microwave. I never cook during my trip. It just a wasted to have a kitchen. I need bigger room. Next time I need to ask in detail what included in the room that I am gonna sleep in.",pos

"...you will be extremely irritated by this mob scene of clueless tourists if you are a somewhat savvy traveler of large metropolitan cities. The GOOD:  views from Times Square view rooms are decent.  Bed is fairly comfortable.  Staff tries like heck to help.  Very good gym with great views. The BAD:  room service food and menu selection, room decor and bathroom. The UGLY: elevator service is terrible.  Those ""clueless tourists"" can't seem to understand this relatively simple elevator system and THAT causing most of the delays.  The check-in is a zoo.  And, of course, the ridiculous amount of fanny-packed tourists who can be heard complaining because they think they are staying in a 5 star hotel....LOL. Funny note:  saw several ""Apprentice"" rejects step on the elevator and look disappointed when nobody acknowledged their minor celebrity.  They didn't even merit a stay at Trump Int'l Hotel....?",neg

"Cool concept, with a hip hotel, crowned by loft-style condo's with great views. Lobby Bar is very trendy, leading into the dining room. Weekend nights, the bar is very crowded. It's a very see and be scene atmosphere. We have friends who have a condo upstairs, and they avoid the bar/restaurant, at those times. They feel they are paying for a public place, instead of a retreat of the privacy of their home. The food is good for woodfire pizza's, but the rest of the menu needs direction. Service is a little confused! The weekend bar crowd is very loud, crude, and one drink wonders who stand around all night. Not classy at all.",neg
I was so disappointed in this hotel. The pictures on the website were nothing like the rooms. We had 2 rooms which were so far from each other. 1 in 1 building and another room in another building. The staff was super nice. They had no cot to lend us. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone.,neg

This the third time in the last month I've stayed at this particular hotel site each time I've had plumbing problems all different in different rooms and different problem don't know if it because of rains or it needs an over all repipe but I think now with this stay it become an unacceptable thing to have to deal with I like everything and is convenient to hospital for me but this problem is starting to get out of control and will begin to chase people away don't know what else to say but everything else is perfect you make up your own mind on this problems but all have been plumbing D.

"This hotel was the best hotel that I ever stayed so far, and might be also in my entire life. Especially, the service was speechless. I got in some trouble but the receptionist helped me a lot even it was out of her concerns. It was really stunning service and I was so impressed. Overall, the location is so nice that you can go everywhere so quickly from this hotel, breakfast was amazing, bedding was so nice and clean. I would stay this hotel for sure whenever I have any chance to go Florence again.",pos
"Everything was amazing...the only issue we had was that valet misplaced the keys to one of our cars. So that pushed our leave back about 30 mins. Come to find out, one of the guys put the key in the drawer next to the safe instead of the safe. Because of the inconvenience, they took the parking fees off not just that one car, but both. Saved us about 270. I wasn't expecting that, but that's real customer service. Everything we wanted was walking distance and the hotel was very safe. Breakfast was mediocre...lots to choose from, but nothing really tasted good. Outside of that, I recommend this place.",pos

Negatives: so-so mattress, noisy nightlife (in the adjacent rooms - very thin walls, I could hear everything in neighboring rooms). I had to ask how to turn on the heat in the room. The TV had a selection of channels, but was missing the one I wanted to watch. (No guide to speak of).",pos

We used the pool and the staff gave my wife a hard time asking for 5 pool towels. If we were rude people, we would have told them off, but we are sometimes overly considerate. This is our chance to tell everyone what we think now. They allow pets here and so things just seemed on the dirty side. Hotel staff, as I indicated, were borderline rude. They were busy when we got there, but no reason to roll your eyes at us. Seriously I wonder what happened to Southern Hospitality and the customer is always right It's not like we asked for anything out of the ordinary.

Main ice machine in our end was not working and looks as though it has not been working for some time. Continental breakfast was great. AC/heat had issues keeping constant temp. TV/Cable was limited TV's really need to be updated to larger screens flat screens. Old-style not very conducive to watching from far bed.

I was disappointed that the bathroom was not en suite, but across the hall (yet ours exclusively). Perhaps I didn't notice this when I booked the room, but it should have been made clear at the time of the booking. At this price point, I expect my own bathroom, attached to the room. Mattress was very hard, but I encounter that at most hotels. But a pleasant room and you can't beat the location! We walked to a restaurant for dinner, then a nice stroll by the beach.",pos
The best thing about this hotel is the staff. Everyone is very friendly and helpful. The hotel is an older property but it is very clean and well taken care of. We wished there had been a hot tub instead of the sauna. The beds are not premium. But we enjoyed our stay and would come back.,pos

This hotel used to offer free parking and now since it's been renamed 'the Kinney' they only offer valet parking for 15. Not super expensive but I would have liked it to be free as I booked it when it was The Inn at Marina Del Rey which offered free parking. The only thing that was not great was the fact that the lobby, corridors and some common areas were under construction. The front desk area smelled of fresh paint and there were constantly workers around. Breakfast was surprisingly good, with scrambled eggs, bacon and a waffle station, with a very nice lady attendant. This hotel was about 15 minute walking from Venice beach and restaurants located next to it.",pos

"This was perhaps the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. The check in process was antiquated and took forever. Then they sprang the surprise: a 75 per room per night security deposit. We had 2 rooms and had booked 3 nights. Translation: we left the front desk 450 lighter than we arrived. The elevators were scary and the line to board the elevator was often 50 or more people. I ended up taking the stairs (to the 7th floor) several times to avoid the line for the elevators. The staff were lackluster at best, often sullen and dismissive. The casino was dull and dated. There were lots of other nasty surprises too numerous to list here. The ONLY redeeming quality was Guy Fieri's restaurant, El Burro Borracho (Spanish for the drunken donkey). We spent most of our time in Laughlin at other casinos and had a great time there. We were drawn in by the low price but after adding in the almost 12 nightly resort fee and the stifling security deposit, it was no bargain. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place!",neg

Harrah's was the best spot if you want to be near the river. It's relaxing to have the view of the river in your room,avg
"Please consider another place for your stay. The management recommended that my companion and I go to the room first to check if any of the lights were out and to make sure the room is properly furnished before we pay for the room because there is a no refund policy. The first room we went in to check had no lights in the living room, the hair dryer was previous stolen, and the room smells like smoke. This hotel is horrible. The furniture, whatever is left of it is broken, dated, and unclean. The furniture smells, the floors will make your feet BLACK in 5 seconds. The bed is a super hard box spring with the thinnest possible bedding on top. The towels provided were so thin, you'd need two to do the job of one.",neg

Did not try the restaurant, but they have a Starbucks in the lobby which is very handy. Room was clean and bed was comfortable. Plenty of towels too. About 2 miles from Disneyland.",pos

The staff at the La Quinta in Bryant is very friendly and helpful. The room was immaculate and had comfortable beds. A great place to stay for a reasonable price and with easy access to restaurants and the freeway.,pos
"This is a nice hotel in that the decor is nice, the bathroom and beds are nice and they have free wine every night.  We found the service and management pretty bad.  The manager lied to us saying first they didn't even offer ""queen sized beds"" when we ended up with two doubles instead of the queen and then blamed it was our fault because we booked on Expedia.  We looked on their website and saw they did offer queen beds and have availability at the time and we then ended getting a room with a queen since ""they just has a cancellation"".  Then we ordered room service, waiting an hour, called back and our order was never even put in.  The girl we had ordered with ""left a long time ago"".  We did get a $25 credit to dine at Jackson 20, though.  Their food is good and it is a fun atmosphere.  Honestly, the Kimpton hotels are nice except for the service.  I believe they just have weak management.  We had a brunch for a baptism the same weekend at their other hotel (Morrison) and they were clearly understaffed and disorganized.  It was terribly slow and the manager of the food place only had one person taking care of 16 of us (this was a prearranged private booked brunch).  The food was good but it took 20 mins to get everyone their entree when it was a preset menu of choosing from two items  Definitely not the fault of the poor guy waiting on us but some problem with the kitchen or management.",avg
"We were traveling with an assist dog and were made to pay 10...not legal for an assist dog. I had to argue for a non-smoking room which they didn't want to give because she said the dog was big.

Also the table and chairs were very crammed in the room. I am a small person and had a very difficult time sitting at the table and trying to do work at the table.  I wouldn't have stayed here based on previous comments, but I needed a room for one night and this was about all that was available. I honestly was tempted to sleep in my car.",neg

"I had read the reviews, and expected a certain level of disrepair being this is an older building. The desk staff is very pleasant, the courtyard when you walk up is cute. The room is a nightmare. I wish I could add photos. The only chair was very wobbly, we never sat on it. When I sat up against the headboard, my shirt stuck to it. The kitchen had huge cracks radiating out all over the wall. The bathroom ceiling had little mold spots over the shower as there was no ventilation. The toilet seat used to be white, but was worn down to the wooden base in most spots. The white shelf over the bathroom sink was literally shredding apart. It looked like an asbestos base that had been soaking in water for a year. It was literally puffing up from inside out. It was a cheap place to stay, but not so cheap that they can't fix basic problems. The neighborhood is right by the key arena. You can walk to the space needle, public transportation is easy from here. A few nights there won't kill you, but you aren't going to want to spend much time in the room!",neg

Then when I finally get in my room into bed I felt something crawling in my ear. On top of a frustrating start they had bed bugs. So not worth the frustration. Never again.,neg

The king size bed was comfortable making for a good night's rest. Our room was outfitted with a microwave, mini fridge and cable tv. The hotel front desk attendant was friendly as was the house keeper. While not directly on the beach, its a relatively short trip to the beach/casinos. The NJ transit system has buses that pass through the area hourly, if you dont happen to drive. Cons:While there is a beverage vending machine and ice machine on site, you would have to go elsewhere for food. Denny's is about a 5min walk from the hotel and you could always order in. All in all a Good stay considering the price.",avg

The hotel room was average at best but I realize it is a ski resort and hard to keep like in a beech resort. Skiers are looking for a dry place to put their wet clothe and ski's for the night.

One suggestion is that hotel should have booklet on the services available in the rooms. Although golf course and spa on site there was no information in rooms. Had to go to spa to find out services rates etched and even then they had nothing to take away. Spa was fully booked out for all of our 4 night stay do couldn't use though we wished to. Pool area very nice. Golf course looks good but didn't use. Overall a pleasant stay in a lovely area.",avg

We have never traveled with our dog and stayed in a hotel and didn't realize he wasnt allowed to stay in the room alone. Since we were there over the 4th of July, we didn't want to bring him out and spook him with the fireworks. So, we stayed cooped up inside all night. We went to the indoor pool, but had to go in shifts so as not to leave the dog alone. It was ok, but the hot tub was way too hot.

"The only saving grace for this inn was the front desk staff who are highly knowledgeable about San Antonio, the places to see and what to avoid. Having said that all the rest was downhill from the cleanliness especially in the kitchen.I can only imagine this was once a pretty recommendable establishment that maybe got overwhelmed with the amount of units to upkeep daily and with kitchenettes in the units comes the constant need to repair the appliances. In our case none of the kitchen appliances worked (fridge, stove, etc.)The location is reliant on a car if you want to see the sites in the city but there are plenty places to eat in the area if you don't mind walking.",neg

"Don't read this if you don't like whining, because as I wrote this, I realized that's what it sounds like... sorry, but if you want 3 stars or more, you've got some work to do. So, we got a good rate through Expedia, felt good about that. Checking in, well that's where the disappointments started. The lady at the desk was not friendly at all, sloppy, no smile, etc. We got the room keys and the room was clean, so okay, going better. The HVAC controls didn't seem to work as we thought they should - eventually it seemed like it was okay - cooled the room down nicely. The bathroom could have been really nice, but the paint on the wall was cracked and starting to chip. The edge of the tub had one chip repaired and another not yet repaired. On to breakfast in the morning. Eggs were overcooked and cold, but otherwise it was generally okay - nothing to write home about. We used the side entrance several times and the scanner seemed like it was broken like the enclosure was missing, which made it awkward to slide the access card for entry. It is in a good location, close to the freeway and several fast food places.",neg
"I wish I could give this place a better review than a 3. The location is convenient and the views spectacular. The main part of the resort, including the restaurant and lounge are lovely. The service was outstanding both at the desk and in the restaurant and the food we ate there was very good. I had two issues, though, which impact this review. The first is that our room was extremely funky. The bathroom didn't appear to have been updated in 20+ years and was covered in mildew. The chrome fixtures were corroded. In the bedroom area, the popcorn ceiling had black streaks from the air vent. The beds' headboards were loosely attached to the beds and would bang against the wall whenever anyone rolled over.The room had nice amenities like a coffee maker and mini refrigerator and the towels were good. As we checked out we were asked about our stay and we were honest about the issues with the room. The person who checked us out mentioned that by this time next year the patio rooms where we stayed will be demolished and a wellness center will go in. My question is that if they know these rooms are bad, why are they still booking people into them",avg

She never said a thing to me or my husband the whole breakfast long and we sat right next to the food (it's a small place). I don't need or even like lots of conversation or loud talking in the morning, but common courtesy and friendliness is paramount in hotel service. Also, there was a discussion going on between her, the front desk girl and another employee (manager) who wore a lanyard around her neck and no uniform. It was about the schedule and some issues with regard to it. The person not wearing the uniform actually came up to the breakfast bar, still talking to someone at the front desk and said, Well, you made the schedule, so I do blame you! Don't mind us customers here trying to have our breakfast folks. So, Hampton management, you lost a star because of unprofessional and unfriendly behavior of two employees.

"th e WiFi doesn't work, there isn't enough room to turn around in the bathroom, the room itself is tiny, the bed isn't even fastened down, so don't lean against the headboard, or you'll go rolling across the room. on checkin you get a lecture on how to set the air conditioner, close the curtains, don't take a long shower. there are signs in the room also saying all these things plus what not to flush.... not exactly a feeling of comfort or hospitality. towels are paper thin. and I could keep going. but it IS clean.",neg

Overall we were pleased with our stay. The only downfall was that we had asked to be notified once our room was ready we had arrived about an hour before check in. When we contacted hotel staff around 45 minutes after allowed check in time we were told our room had been ready. Very frustrating on a cold rainy day when we just wanted to get settled.,pos
Stopped here on the way from Grand tetons to the Badlands. Good place to stop d/t the town had a grocery store we could restock and refuel. Very dissapointed in only one thing: the hot tub was not even bathtub temperature. We were so looking forward to this after four days of hiking/camping before 3 more days of hiking/camping. told the front desk worker about the problem and she said she would look into it but it didn't really help us bc of only staying one night. do not know if the problem was resolved or not.,pos
The staff is over the top friendly and supportive. The staffs superior and wonderful attitude makes it a fantastic place I highly recommend..,pos
we loved our stay. the view from our room 410 was awesome. the view from the pool and many other spots you can't ask for better. staff was all friendly. bartenders were very knowledgeable also. enjoyed our time in the area. near many of the spots you might want to see and far enough to get away from the city. we are from Houston and love the Austin area. can't wait to stay here again..,pos
"We try to always stay here when visiting the kids/grandkids (2/5). The staff is very accomodating to all out needs. Been staying here over 10 yrs. No better place in town for the money, and we've stayed at them all. But always a little disappointed that there's no frig or microwave in the room. Love the pool and game room, none finer. Learned something new on the last stay. No longer is the best rate available over the counter with discussion. Now it's on-line. The times are a-changing.",pos
Mystay was awful. This hotel needs to be shut down and burnt to the ground. The rooms was mildewed and smelled awful. Every single room we encountered had BEDBUGS and they refused to give us a refund for our unpleasant stay. PLEASE REMOVE THIS HOTEL FROM HOTELS.COM this was awful.,neg
The breakfast was excellent. They had a little something for everyone. The staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel was clean.the only thing that the hotel didn't have was an indoor pool.,pos
"This hotel wreaks of opulence from another era and is truly quirky in its display of furnishings and artifacts. It is very heavy-handed on Venetian silk brocades and the lighting stays dimly lit in the main salon, creating the feel of an elegant bordello. My room, though tiny, was a welcomed sanctuary at the end of long days perusing the Bienalle and museums and galleries. The rooms vary in colour and I was fortunate to have one of the more subdued ones in the beige tones. A stone's throw from San Marco and close to multiple vaporetta stops, the hotel offers a compromise between luxury and convenience. My major objection is that it is situated on a major pedestrian walkway with crowds of tourists that don't let up until the evening. There are rows of public benches right in front of the entrance that attract a crowd of tourists every night and it can be noisy especially during the hot summer. For those who want peace and quiet, ask for a room facing the garden in the back. There is a power generator for the air-conditioning next to the garden which can be annoying, but the sound proofing on the windows works well.",pos

We were fortunate to have a view of the lake through the trees. The room had 2 double beds, TV, fridge and internet access. Everything was very clean and the toiletries are very nice. There is a large pool and hot tub which we enjoyed. We went next door to the Lazy Moose for dinner. The walleye chowder was really really good as was the grilled walleye and steak.",pos

"We chose Residence Inn by Marriott Irvine basically for its convenient location near the airport. Because of the convenient and complimentary hotel shuttle, it allowed us to make our visit to Orange County without having to rent a car. A local cab took us to our primary social event of that week-end. In addition to the convenience of the location, we were totally pleased to find our accommodations so exceptional as well as being able to enjoy the host of amenities that were offered by the hotel. And lastly, I cannot overlook the staff. They were exceptional people - and those include the breakfast area hosts who keep the area always stocked and continually tidy throughout the various time frames of breakfast. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would choose Residence Inn by Marriott Irvine again on our next visit.",pos

"I booked the 2nd time and stayed some days private with my partner and some days for business. Regarding to the 1st stay (one year ago) the situation changed in the worse direction: Even I'm a re-booker and I booked early with the wish to have the room in the direction to the quiet garden side (like last year) the hotel put me to the street side which is horrible loud even in the night which makes it impossible to sleep with open windows. The breakfast is very poor in the scope and in quality. One day old and hard bread, another day the broken coffee machine. Lot of times empty plates in the buffet have been refilled not till we asked to do so. But the worse is that now there are cats allways in the breakfast room. I really like cats and they are sweet but when guests first touch them and later e.g. the bread of the buffet that is far away from simple hygienic roules. Other guests (e.g. with allergy) will be amused very much.",neg

"This Hotel is a Joke!!! When we arrived it was after 4pm and we had to wait an hour for our room to be cleaned. Then when we finally got the keys they tried to put us in a much cheaper, smaller room than I had already paid for!After we finally got the correct room, that I'm sure was already ready when we first arrived at 4:15 pm, The room smelled terrible, it smelled like animal urine !!!But guess what, No body that worked their cared. Also the pictures they put on their website is totally false advertising, they have pictures of the beach area that make it look like your right on the beach! Says your only steps from the beach. No its quiet away from the beach which is a private beach that you have to reserve ahead of time so that you can go the next day and pick them up at another location and pay 12 per person to enter the beach area. The only good thing about are stay was that we we only 3 miles to Sand Harbor state beach park that is a very nice place.",neg

"Rarely is a hotel part of our vacation experience (it's usually just a place to sleep). The atmosphere of Lamonthe House was completely tranquil in a big city, steps from Bourbon, the streetcar, and Frenchman streets. The pool and courtyard, as well as our private patio right outside our room was superb. Strongly recommend this to visitors visiting New Orleans who need a place to recover from their long walks and party ventures. Only critique items would be that the hot tub portion of the swimming pool could have been cleaned more often, with particles accumulating to not so pleasing levels. Also, there was a periodic smell in the bathroom which probably came through the pipes, but it didn't stay around for long periods or creep into the room. Also could not accommodate a 1 hr late checkout for some reason, which put us in a bit of a panic on our last morning.",pos

"Cozy Hotel, in a calm area, yet walking distance (Within 25 minutes to Charles De Gaulle Etoile) from downtown. Nice staff. Clean overall. Facilities in the room are good including the bathroom. However, like most hotels in Paris, the room is a bit small for a 4 stars hotel. The elevator is very tiny, fits only one person with his big luggage. around 500m to RER C and metro",pos

"Stayed at the hotel a few days. It's a no-frills place: No fitness center no vending machines as far as I could see balcony slide door lock didn't work, though there was a safety bar very small lobby housekeeping came after the first day and thereafter only to take old towels. And no dining or bar facility on site. But the hotel is up-front about all that, so no real penalty. Also, the hallway carpet was missing because it is being replaced, but hey, at least that means that they refresh the facilities every so often. Most importantly, though, the room itself was clean and quiet. And there is free breakfast. So take it for what it is: a clean, basic facility that will save you some money compared to most other hotels in the area.",pos

There is no 24 hours lobby so there was no one to call when there was a party in the parking lot and people were up all hours partying right outside our door. The staff is all new and the new owners stated they bought the Inn a month ago and were unable to make changes due to the season having already started and stated big changes were coming. I tend to believe them as they were all great people they just happened purchased a motel that needs a lot of work. so due to the smell, water, and lack of security this is one of the worst if not the worst hotel experience I have ever had. Id love my money back but I know there's no hope of that.",neg

"My son and I were just passing through town on our way to PA where he attends University. As usual, I booked a non-smoking room, which was confirmed at check-in. It was clear however that the room was, at best, a 'converted' smoking room (it was room 115 if you want to know). In addition to the overall residual smell of smoke in the room, the bathroom was extremelly smelly. It was interesting to note that all the rooms but ours had a room number with a non-smoking or smoking symbol on it (hmmmm...) Room 115 was also at the beginning of the 'smoking' rooms along the hallway, and if I remember correct, the room across the hall was a smoking room. We'd already checked and the only other comperable room was a true smoking room, so we bucked up and stayed the night. I'll be avoiding this Comfort Inn on any future trips.",avg

"If you're looking for a hotel where the action is, go elsewhere. The hotel is on the Lido, which is about a 10-15 minute waterbus ride away from Venice. However, if you're looking for a place on the Lido, this is a well-priced option. The staff was great with handling/recommending dinner reservations, even during an insane Carnevale weekend. The doors are a little thin and since the building is old, the soundproofing needs improvement. The quarters are cramped, but the room comes with breakfast. If we wanted to stay on the Lido again, this would be a good option, but next time I think we'll opt for a place closer to the action. Recommended.",avg

"The Merritt House Inn had almost everything we needed for this trip. With the exception of a hot tub (a luxury for sure), we had a quaint, historic lodging that was comfortable and walking distance to everything we wanted to do. The only gripe we had, which could be a big deal for many travelers, is that the sound insulation is terrible. There was a guy that sounded like he was coughing up a lung for several hours at a time that made it challenging to stay asleep, in the room next to ours, and additionally the same couple had a fight and we could hear the hilarious use of British swear words. I'd imagine they'd have moved us to a different room had we asked - thankfully the gent seems to have gotten cough medicine after the first night and we managed just fine. But staff was nice, breakfast was lovely, and the fireplace was magic.",pos

"So, I am rating this based off of affordable hotels is Santa Cruz. If you want to be close to the boardwalk and the wharf this is a decent place to stay for under 200. I am pretty particular when I stay at a hotel, my favorite is holiday inn express or best western plus. I totally lower my expectations when I stay in Santa Cruz because I want to walk everywhere. We really only shower and sleep in the room. It has heating and air which is nice. I was happy it had a microwave and refrigerator, which my best western plus in Santa Barbara a day earlier did not.(Hard with a baby) It has free parking, just make sure your parking brake works properly! The bed was actually very, very comfortable. It's Santa Cruz, all the hotels are old and dingy unless you spring for a 500+ hotel.",avg

The building was reasonably attractive but appears to be used more as long term accommodation by a number of people rather than as a traditional hotel. As a result there were no plates, cups, coffee, tea etc. in the room. The bathroom shower was showing its age as was the sink. The beds and pillows were the least comfortable we encountered on our trip. A free breakfast was advertised but this consisted of coffee, muffins, some fruit and porridge - the most miserly of any free breakfast we encountered on our trip.

Second, when we returned to the hotel at 10pm, I was putting my 1 year old child to sleep when black bugs started to jump on us. My husband and I later agreed that it had to be fleas.

"This was the worst motel room I've ever stayed in. The bedspreads were torn and stained, filth all over the carpet. Shoe marks all over the back of the door and bathroom door. Spiders in the bathroom. A shower head that sprayed you on your chest and had to squat down to wash my hair. There was dust covering everything. Old food stains on the microwave, the wall and behind. It smelled like someone chained smoked for a week and it was a non-smoking. Missing a blanket on the bed. Pillows were insanely tiny and flat. Broken clock. Drunk people all over the balcony and below us. Someone banged on our door at 5am and ran away. The ironing board, with no cover, didn't stand. The absolute worst place ever. I wouldn't stay there again even if I was homeless!",neg

"The hotel was unimpressive from the parking lot, however, when you walked in and made it to your room it was outstanding! Almost had a BB feel with tailored wall hangings and a very home-like kind of feel. Views from the sound side balcony were beautiful. One downfall of the area...cops. We arrived in the area around 9pm and literally saw 10-15 squad cars in a variety of areas, lights flashing, harassing either people walking down the street or people in their vehicles. We actually thought something big had gone down by the sheer number of cops. The next day our family pulled out of the hotel and had driven no more than a mile when a cop stuck his head out of his squad car looking at us, flipped a u-turn and ran a red light at excessive speeds with his lights on to pull us over...for a seatbelt. After receiving the 170 ticket we left the area and went back to Topsail for the day. Absolutely loved the hotel, but probably will avoid the area in the future because of the cops.",pos

I called the front desk and was told - well what would you like me to do. Changing rooms was apparently not an option. I finally attempted to use the shower and the drain didn't work and water flooded all over the bathroom. I then used the incredibly tattered towels to attempt to mop up the bathroom. Someone should have informed me that I was being giving and ADA room...and then imagine if you were in a wheelchair and had to use a flooding bathroom! Disgusting and disappointing. Will never stay there again.",neg

However, the next morning I found out that the first attempt at extending my stay was completely botched and I had to do it all over again with a new attendant. Other than that one thing, it was a pleasant stay. Nothing special, but nothing I would stay away from either.",pos
Stayed for a conference at Cleveland Clinic. Great rooms. Amazing breakfast. Very Clean. Staff is very professional.,pos
First room checked into the room smelled of dog and urine so bad that my throat stared to close off and I couldn't breath. I went down to the front desk and they were giving some difficulty because I made the reservation on. We hen I told them I had allergies and can't stay in that room is when they gave me another room. That rooms beds are like sleeping in conceret and the sheet have holes in them so you can see the matteress. The towels have holes in them and are so rough they feel like sandpaper. I booked this hotel because I had a pool and said limited pets. Well the pool is broken too. If it wasn't for the fact that I'm here because a family had an accident and is in the hospital I would not stay here. Since it's also a holiday weekend rooms are limited. I can say NEVER AGAIN WILL I STAY HERE!,neg
"I was surprised to see that it was so far away from Frankfurt!!! I also didn't know that you had to PAY for Internet access, so it was a major downgrade for comfort.

"Mediocre resort, the crowds were absurd, (the line for rentals was about 2.5 hours) and by the time we got rentals, they were out of certain sizes of skis and were making substitutions or asking people to wait fo returns. r r The trails, arguably the best part of the resort, only suit intermediate to advanced skiers. Their beginner trails are poorly marked, few and far between, and overly crowded. The advanced trails are too easy for those accustomed to skiing in Colorado. r r ...view moreService wise, the staff is a bit lazy, uninformed, and sometimes downright rude. There were multiple instances of being brushed aside when requesting help and multiple instances of staff members standing idly by while lines formed out the door. r r And suffice to say, the price that they charge is definitely not worth the experience you get. The food, which is understandably overpriced, was not fresh and caused a member of our party to get two days worth of stomach troubles from the cafeteria food. . r r In conclusion, avoid at all costs unless you really have no other choice.

The facility was extremely poorly maintained, the room was in very bad condition, the staff were adequate, but hardly what one would expect for such a grand place.

"As many others have said, the motel is now a Travelodge. When we drove up, it was obvious that the building was under construction as the rooms we could see were full of construction materials. Check in was quick. The clerk was indifferent about out stay. The room was very basic. Again why I call it a motel and not a hotel. The sink and vanity were in the main room, but that didn't matter since the door to the bathroom didn't close all the way. The room wasn't spectacular, but could have used a little more TLC. They could have included towels so we could use the shampoo, conditioner and soap that were provided. Overall, although I needed to spend as little money on my trip as possible, in the future I will shave 20 off of anything else including my food budget to get a better room elsewhere.",neg

"While this is a very nice motel and I would not only return here for a good price and nice room, my stay was marred by my truck being burgled in the SB Marina while I was on a 3-day cruise of the Channel Islands National Park preceding my motel stay. Parking near the Sea Landing pier (southeast end), I take responsibility for leaving my bowling bag covered in the back seat floor, yet still visible. However, there is NO camera security on this end of the parking lot, and you can bet the thieves know this. So, great motel, unhappy vacation. My fault. Personal property almost worthless on the black market. On the morning of my departure the PD was so busy it could not get to this motel for an interview/report of the theft. I can only speculate as to how bad crime is in SB, and, of course, no one in the hospitality industry is going to reveal a problem that would negatively reflect on the town.",pos

We visited twice in 12 day holiday. My wife fell in love with it and took lots of interior photos. The first visit was after a flight delay and then problems with the GPS/Satnav which meant a five hour total delay. We were given TLC at check in and drinks vouchers for their bar restaurant. The food was good and a really nice Friday night atmosphere in the restaurant. We rushed off early the next morning. The second visit for two nights was also good. We had a room with a balcony which was unusual for the USA and we enjoyed this opportunity to read and relax on the balcony. Another good meal in the restaurant on the second night.,pos

"Good: someone outside of the hotel left a package for me at the front desk. They were nice enough to remember to give it to me when I checked in. Service people were nice and housekeeping did a good job. Bad: A/C kept cutting out after 10-30 minutes. Not having functional A/C in Chico in the middle of July is kind of important... The controls on the unit were relocated for your convenience to the wall near the bathroom. They also must have installed some sort of temperature or time limiter on it. Room got up to 83 before I went to the control unit and changed the fan from high to low in order to jump start the A/C unit again. Queen size bed was really a Full. Towels in bathroom were made for dwarves. Came late for breakfast, but all I saw were danishes, Fruit Loops, Captain Crunch, milk and apples. Better than nothing.",neg

"The pros: close to downtown Kona and actually on the coast. There is no beach, but the volcanic rocks below our room housed all sorts of crabs, fish and eels to check out. The room had a washer and dryer, which are essential for a longer stay or if you plan on doing a lot of beach activities The cons: Old, hard beds. The air conditioning was a wall unit and did not reach into the bedroom. The only reason that we stayed was the Murphy bed in the front room. We were cool and could watch the sunset from bed. The WiFi is very slow. Individual units are owned by different people, so finishes vary. We were in D34",avg

Constantly requesting for fresh towels. Hotels idea of a king bed was 2 uneven single beds pushed together that kept moving apart whilst sleeping. Breakfast was very disappointing!

"We have stayed here few times before with good experience. Staff was great, the room was clean, hotel shows wear for age. There were some security issues this time as there were persons sleeping in the restaurant 2 mornings that had to be escorted out. We found the hallways to have debris that should have been cleaned up with housekeeping and was not. Few cars were double parked behind guests because they were using the beach access and nothing was done until end of day. There were no cameras and we saw people lingering in halls. We heard it was Beach week which sometimes has issues. Will not stay here again.",avg

"I stepped out of my comfort zone decided to take a trip alone. Although I didn't get to the hotel until 1am, The young man at the front desk was very polite and welcoming. The room was clean and waking up in the morning to a site of trees and log cabin style buildings was a great refresher. The staff was always courteous and attentive to any questions and request that I had. The hotel is located perfectly on the mountain giving easy access to the gondolas and other activities within walking distance. Already booked a week stay over Thanksgiving with the family. Would definitely suggest this hotel to anyone going to Mountain Village/Telluride.",pos
Average Hotel. Expensive for the quality. I will not recommend it. Accept pets. It is near Sawgrass Mills.,avg

"Hotel was clean and room size was fine. Mini fridge and microwave in room were a plus. Pool area was nice with good sized pool and fitness equipment. Restaurant food was good (we got a 14 credit to use for breakfast between the three of us so it still cost 20) but service was very slow. The first floor, which we walked through to get to the elevator, reeked of cigarette smoke. This can be avoided by parking out back or using the stairs. My biggest complaint was the WIFI. I paid for a hotel rather than camping because I needed WIFI to get some work done. While I could get my phone to connect, my computer would not recognize the free signal. After 20 minutes on hold with the tech support group, the answer that I got was to sit next to the door. This worked to connect but the signal dropped again once I moved back into the room. The promise that they would reset the signal did not seem to be kept as this was an issue both nights I was there. Overall this was a decent hotel and much better than what others in our group experienced at competitors in the area.",avg
The front desk and kitchen staff were all very friendly and welcoming. BUT the housekeeping was very loud in the hallways and they didn't clean our room during our stay. The walls are very thin and you can hear everything through the walls and doors.,neg

To our surprise the hotel is under construction therefore the pool is not working at point. Also the hotel had a water leak therefore we didn't have water. We asked for management to move us to another comfort inn within 8miles radius. It was an inconvenient especially when your children are coming along.,neg
"The staff was very friendly. The room was clean except for the spider webs that were on all the light fixtures and hanging over the bed. Big breakfast, but the omelet was cold in the middle and the biscuits were very crunchy. I have stayed at Holiday Inn Express hotels before and never had a complaint.

I paid over 200 a night to stay at this motel. It is not a hotel and should be classified as such. It should have been priced no more than 75 a day. It looks old and run down and it was totally out of my style. The pictures on the Internet to advertise must be fake as it's not what you get.,neg

My business travel puta me in this town often and after staying in most all of the hotels available this hits my number one every time. Convenient to most everything in minutes(downtown, mall, Presque Isle , Casino etc) even with the road construction. Would stay here and recommend to everyone as most consistent to task and always the cleanest regardless of the name or money spent!",pos
"The rooms are very small, but very pretty decorated and extremely clean. At the end of the day you'll need just a bed to throw yourself in, and this hotel will do the work. Is quiet, clean and coquette! The elevetor, on the other hand, is very small. I don't believe I've seen a smaller elevator. The breakfast is basic (omelet, sausages, coffee, tea, butter, jam, cheese and croissants) an a little bit expensive (15 euros), but these are the prices in Paris. The area is very quiet and if you go straight to Avenue Mac-Mahon you'll reach Arc de Triomphe, by foot, in 15 minutes. There, near the Kleber metro station you can take the L'Open Tour Bus (the green line) which, combined with the yellow, blue and orange line, will take you everywhere in Paris. It's an easy reach to the Paris city centre and a charming hotel!",pos

Only downside was no elevator, so pack light or be prepared to haul luggage up stairs!",avg

We had a huge balcony with great views. My children loved watching the wild Dolphins swim from our room. I love that this hotel is close to the center of the boardwalk so you have many options to dine and shop. Free breakfast was amazing!.Even with many people gathering at breakfast, there were many options and the staff were really friendly and kept everything clean and well stocked.

"The experience was very good. We enjoyed our upgrade, great view of the city. The hot breakfast is a nice perk as well as the kickback time. I will definetly stay again. The Staff is very nice. Thanks Kevin!",pos
"The room had no towels, when we did ask for towels they were going to send house keeping right up, that never happened. There was no TV remote, there was no ash tray (in a smoking room, nothing I would complain about usually but since there's so many others that ticked me off too) the cable line didn't even fit into the TV so all 13 of my channels barely came through. There are no movie channels so that's also a lie. The phone had no cord to the wall or to phone from the base. So when I finally did decide to complain about the towels I couldn't even call. The room was freezing, and disgusting. Was over all extremely disappointed. I wasn't expecting high class, but come on. That was horrible.",neg

Good overall experience! Will definitely go back.recommended!,pos
"The desk staff were rude and acted like they didn't have the time of day for any of our questions or requests. The breakfast bar had great bagels but not much else. I mean, who ever heard of putting Swiss cake rolls out for breakfast? Pool was closed for repairs which was one of the main reasons we had chosen it but no mention of the upcoming repairs was mentioned when I called to inquire about it. Howard Johnson's used to represent quality when I was a kid but this one gives the company a bad name.",neg

"Although our room was large enough for our family and was noted to have been cleaned, the blankets had stains on them. We also had a lot of trouble with the bathroom. It was fixed the next day, but an inconvenience the first day of our stay. As we were checking out another couple was complaining to the front desk of a similar incidence. There also seemed to be people that just hung out in the parking lot, which made us uncomfortable.",neg

Great extras,pos

"While doing your renovations you should have made the place accessible. The lobby had steps, and the smoking area was not accessible",pos
Motel is short staffed. Condition of rooms and pool are poor. We only stayed because it was a pet friendly motel.,avg

"Typical road motel that hasn't been updated in awhile but the rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable. If you're looking for luxury, elegance, and price-gouged frou frou accommodations, go someplace else. If you're smart, and would rather spend your hard-earned money on fine wine and dining as well as on pampering yourself (Calistoga mud baths!), this is a safe clean place to lay down your head. Just a short 3 minute drive to downtown Napa, and easy access to the main highway leading to all the wineries. Surprisingly good coffee. The free breakfast is enough to get you on the road but the breakfast itself is fairly mediocre.",pos
"We just needed a room for 8 hours sleep, before picking up our son from college. This hotel should be rated 1 star for physical condition and the ambiance and setting is even worse. It literally backs right up to I-10 and it must be in a marginal neighborhood, because even at 10:00 pm they were only doing business through a bullet proof outside window. I can't believe they still have a Super 8 franchise, and you are much better off with one of the no-brand motels on Indian Hill in Claremont. We stay in this area often, and we will never go back to this hotel even for 8 hours sleep.",neg
Great hotel,pos
Loved the large room and sectional sofa. Great for relaxing after a long day.,pos

Also, they provide secure parking in an underground garage for... More",pos
"Gyn was fabulous and very detail oriented- she executed our wedding and rehearsal dinner very well and worked very hard to make sure that things went smoothly- she and her staff made the room look beautiful with the many accessories I brought- photo collage, table scape confetti, etc. She was also very flexible and easy to work with.There were just a couple issues to be aware of- read the contract very carefully before signing, or better yet, have whomever is paying sign the contract. There was a misunderstanding about discounts on weddings that take place during the week- evidently, they calculated the discount without letting me know what the full price was. Also, they displayed the supplement desserts and ice cream before our cake was served, which didn't make any sense and I ended up taking home most of my wedding cake. Also, reminder to brides: If your parents are part of the processional and have reserved seating, please have someone place wedding programs on their seats! Neither of our parents had programs during the service and this was disappointing and added confusion to their participation!Be aware, at the Hyatt Dulles you will pay 22% gratuity and 5% tax for all food and beverage- even the breakfast brunch, which was self serve and the omelette station wasn't manned during our brunch. This was very overpriced and there wasn't much service to justify this exorbitant fee.",pos
"The staff was friendly and courteous. The room was clean and there was a great breakfast in the morning. The bathroom sink was extremely slow to drain, but it didn't cause any big problems. I am sure it was an easy fix, but unfortunately, I forgot to mention it when we checked out. We enjoyed our stay and would stay there again.",pos
"Good value. Service was generally good. Front desk check in/check out and service folks were friendly and helpful, routinely asking how I was and if they could help with anything. On the negative end, they either forgot to clean my room one day or they simply do not clean rooms daily. They probably would have cleaned the room had I called the desk to ask, but it was not a big enough concern for me to ask. Overall a good experience.",pos
We booked this hotel as part of a locals special that was going on. First and foremost I must say that every single employee that was encountered were absolutely wonderful.

The bed is as hard as a rock and I woke up from back pain and my husband got back pain too later in the week. I really like that there is a little kitchen but the oven didn't work at all. One window was completely covered by ivy so we couldn't use it. The other two windows were okay but we couldn't leave them open so we used the ac a lot. The staff was very friendly and had good recommendations for restaurants in walking distance. Our favorite part was the location because it is next to a market with amazing cheap dinners and lunches.,avg

"You cannot beat this location. It is on Bourbon St (the name changes on the other side of Canal), just a 5 minute walk away. Rooms are nice - big and clean, comfy beds. The free breakfast was really good too (one of the best I've seen at a hotel) and definitely saved us the expense of eating out for breakfast every day. Wi-fi is free, but there is also a paid option an somehow we were charged although we did not select this option. We asked about this upon check out and they took the charges off no questions. The only thing I wish I had realized before booking was that parking is not included and after taxes cost about 40/night. Had I realized this, I would have taken it into consideration of the total cost of the room.",pos

"Decent hotel, but not a worthy member of Small Luxury Hotels of the World. The room was ok, as was the service. However, it is located a few meters from the main road from Bonifacio to Ajaccio, and you can hear the traffic noise even with the balcony door closed. They ran out of several items at the overpriced breakfast (EUR 30/person) before closing. Housekeeping was ok, but several small mistakes that you wouldn't expect from a 5* hotel. Reception staff was friendly. Nice, but small pool. Charged EUR 10 for a beach towel plus umbrella. Fantastic beaches within 30 mins drive. Beautiful views from the terrace. Dinner was average, but expensive relative to what you could get anywhere else. In sum: Would be good as a 4* hotel (if priced accordingly), but not worth the price and not the standard of a real 5* hotel",avg
the room was terrible and it was in the worst part of town. the mattress was on top of a piece of plywood on the bed frame,neg
Friendly staff. Convenient location right off of I-30. Directly across the road from a large mall and several eating options Was a little older property but everything worked well except disabled lift for the hot tub. Good breakfast options. Would definitely stay here again.,pos
"This hotel needs attention to detail. The tv remote was missing from the room, the tub caulk was black and needed recaulking, the soap dish in the shower had months of soap build up, etc. Nothing major, just a complete absence of detail. This is what I would expect if it was a low rate hotel but not for their asking rates.",avg
"Stayed here while attending a conference at Harvard. Not within walking distance, but I had a rental car. The hotel was great! Everything was new, free parking, clean, the wifi worked the whole time, and the breakfast was good. Lots to choose from bacon, sausage, omelettes, pancakes, pastries, fruit, yogurt, coffee. The hotel is located right next to a large grocery store, so it's easy to get a quick meal or snack.",pos
Terrible hotel. The beds were super hard. No refrigerators. People hanging outside,neg

She greets all of her guest with a smile, and is always looking to provide excellent service. My 6 year old daughter remembered Linda from our last visit. The free hot breakfast is awesome!",pos
"The rooms were decorated in a fun way that my daughter enjoyed. The staff was very friendly eager to fix problems. The pool was nice and clean, but small.The walls are very thin and when the air conditioner stops you can hear everything in the halls and neighboring rooms. The bed was very uncomfortable. Unfortunately, a lot of the cute decor was falling apart, and nothing except the bedding felt very clean. The halls and stairwells were pretty dirty and don't seem to get cleaned, also have quite a musty smell. The wifi never connected and we had to go outside of the hotel to get reception for Internet. The ice and drink machines broke down while we were there, but the staff did jump on it trying to fix it quickly. Ok for a couple of nights, but honestly for the money we spent we could have stayed at other spots closer to the shore and more updated.",avg
"Very convenient location- 4 minute walk from the visitor center ( where you can catch the Zion shuttle). Rooms are nice, big and cozy, with amazing view to the mountains. Tip: check out the pool, it is magnificent with the view behind it and a great place to spend couple of hours when it is too hot to hike.",pos
"Just be aware they make the front desk agent also take care of the breakfast bar. So give yourself some time if you must check out at the desk. The breakfast is a very good standard La Quinta breakfast. Scrambled eggs, breakfast meat, waffle maker, cereal, breads, oj, milk coffee etc.",pos
"As the saying goes, you get what you pay for. This was one of the cheaper hotels available, and we only needed a place to stay for a brief overnight visit so opted for the lesser rate/lesser hotel. Room smelled of old smoke (even though a non-smoking room), in-room coffee pot was actually dusty, arm on recliner was missing, no drinking cups in bathroom, carpet had not been swept in corners and bathroom floor had debris like it had not been swept, either. Staff was friendly and room was cheap, but wouldn't recommend this hotel.",neg

The carpets were threadbare and apparently held together by a cement like mix of dirt and mystery spills. The only positives were the receptionist and the location. It also looked very nice from the outside.",neg

Booked room here due to most other rooms in the area were either booked, or were price gouging due to UTK game weekend. Rate on Hotels.com was slightly higher than normal, but still very reasonable. Room primarily just used to sleep and prepare to go back to campus. Exterior doesn't look like much, but room was clean, and obviously updated in the last couple of years. Personnel at desk were very friendly and helpful. Property is close and convenient (less traffic than normal) to the campus and downtown area (5-10 minutes). Only real downside is not being able to walk to campus, and lack of shopping/dining options in close proximity. We would definitely stay here again when visiting the university.",avg

Not as nice as we have come to expect LaQuintas to be,avg
the room was very clean. staff was very good. very willing to give us info about the area. places to eat and how far we were from the pier and all the attractions on the pier.

The hotel is old and shows it. The plumbing was difficult (hard to turn on faucet at sink...had to get my husband to do it. The pillows were crazy cheap and lumpy, but we travel with our own. Breakfast was sad, few pieces of old fruit, no protein (no eggs, yogurt, cheese etc.) but instant oatmeal ok with me and I have my own cooler. Convenient to highway, fine for short walk before second day of travel. So, worked for us but I don't recommend for anyone with expectations re: above.",avg

However, my main problem with the room was the bathroom. It was full of mildew, and the door didn't close. The toilet had mold in it, and you had to hold the handle down for awhile to make it flush all the way. Every time you turned on the bathroom light, the exhaust fan groaned in a very unpleasant way, I think it was broken. The entire room was very dusty and full of cobwebs. It looked like it wasn't even cleaned. The next time I go to visit my son at college I won't stay there.",neg

The only (small) issue we had is that AC unit was a bit loud - but since we are getting to the warmer days, it is expected that the unit needs to work hard to keep the room at a certain temperature. We thought it was really convenient that they provided little items that are easily forgotten: toothbrush/paste, phone charger, etc - upon request.",pos

"I just hate the bar on top - ""The View"" !!! Aside from the view that's fantastic, there's really nothing to it. The staff is very rude. I always get asked if I have 21 in the worst possible way. Last time my family dragged me there I had to listen to the waiter explain to my mom that there is alcohol in the strawberry margarita - like she was some kind of moron. Once you order you can NEVER  get them to come again and unserve your plates or bring you something additional. The cocktails are nasty - too sugary and/or watery, tasteless. There's also no dress code and it seems like they let just about anyone in there. Bad place.",neg

This is a newer hotel and is quite clean. Ample parking. Elevator to 2nd and 3rd floors. Good beds. Good housekeeping. Super friendly front desk. Only drawback is that it is not close to any restaurants - just a fast food and a couple of bar/grills. Internet seemed to bog down at times.,pos

If you have trouble going up stairs to get to your room it's not the place for you. We ordered breakfast and we're told it would be half an hour. One hour later I called asking where breakfast was because the hotel tablet said it had been delivered, the girl on the phone said it hadn't even been started and did we still want it. I said no. 10 minutes later the cafe management came to our room (where there is a do no disturb sign) banging on our door trying to bully us into reordering breakfast because he said they cannot waste food. The food had not been made according to the girl I spoke to. They lied. The place is rundown and they will try and bully you into buying food. You'll probably be better off at a motel 6.",neg

The sink was broken and contained standing water (my husband fixed it). The topper The bed linens had NOT been changed. They contained hair and questionable stains.

We attempted to find other accommodations for the night, but no local hotels had any vacancies.",neg
"We stayed here the night before a 5k Color Run. The room was very clean - but my son did find a skittle under the bed, wedged into the corner. I think it's his goal to find 'anything' when he enters a hotel room. The beds were very comfy as were the pillows, and we were even able to enjoy the pool for a while. All in all this was a very nice hotel and the staff was great. They didn't even cringe when we walked back in after the run covered in wild colors :-)",pos

For what we paid for our night at this hotel we found it just okay. This place is very dated. The carpet in our room had large stains and it felt like you were walking over huge bumps in it. We had a ground floor room and it sounded like the person overhead was picking up his luggage and bouncing it off the floor. This continued until well after 11:30 pm.,neg

The location was good. The breakfast was lacking. I guess we probably would not stay here again. I feel bad writing this but it is the truth. Maybe they will improve in the future.

On-site entertainment during the day is just right (not too much of it) and the night time shows were very well presented - the kids loved it. The beach is 2 minutes walk away and there are pools galore to have fun in. And one or two outside bars too! We'll no doubt be returning in the next few years.",pos

"Upon check-in the gentleman at the front desk had a hard time figuring out how to put two cards toward the room (we split the cost of 6 nights in a 2bdrm suite with my mother). He had to ask for help, which is fine, but it took forever and this incident came back to haunt us. The carpet was disgustingly filthy in our room! We all had black dirt and grime under our feet after only 2 hours of being in the room! The dishes in the cupboards were all dirty. ALL of them! It was so gross. There was dried food on everything. Check out was a nightmare for my mother. The two people working the front desk at check-in did not swipe our credit cards correctly and there was no record of my card ever being swiped. Which is INSANE because we actually saw them do it! At this point my family and I were already on an airplane home, so my poor mom had to check out alone and deal with this. They put the entire cost of the room on her credit card because there was no record of my card. We aren't a rich family. We saved for a very long time to afford this trip and in one swipe this Residence Inn completely ruined my mother financially. Even after admitting it was their mistake the hotel manager never offered my mother any sort of consolation. No discount, no coupon for a future stay, nothing. They just shrugged their shoulders.

We have stayed in the south location by the Dayton mall and always enjoy our service, and the room... However, this location seems less organized and not as up kept. The employees parked wherever they wanted, maintenance trucks taking up half the parking lot (not even in spaces) and making it difficult since it was a one way driveway. Also, the bed was VERY hard and uncomfortable, I almost preferred the sofa pull out mattress. Our mirror was cracked, which wouldn't have been a big deal if we didn't have a toddler trying to touch it... And the tub was clogging when we showered. Also, the stove kept randomly turning on.. Yes seriously.. Just clicked on. Our sink faucet had a steady drip as well as the bathroom cold knob did not turn (but the hot water also never got hot).",avg

"Second time I have stayed here in the last month. Both times the check-in procedure was lacking. My experience upon check-in both times went like this: Upon arrival there was nobody at the front desk. My first visit I just waited it out. But on my second visit, after waiting a few minutes at the front desk, I called the hotel from my phone. An employee walked out from the back office area (both times eating chips from a bag) to answer the phone- which was only me and I had just hung up. After that check-in was pretty easy. You just have to lure an employee to the front desk to get them there. The room was decent for the price. Checkout both times the front desk person was non-existant (hey! Just like check-in!). Seeing how I was checking out of a hotel near a major airport then time is of the essence. So I didn't play their game upon check-out. I just left my key cards on the computer keyboard then left. For the price it is an excellent stay if you are needing to catch a flight. And in the same train of thought... you get what you pay for not much. I'll probably stay here again. I am an old pro at their game now. The coolest thing about staying here before you go on a trip is that when you compare the service and attentiveness at the hotel you are going to to this one, you will be overly impressed!",neg

He passed me a paper to fill out with my contact information so I could have a receipt. As he proceeded to check me in the price hotel.com promised was a dollar less than what he was charging me which means that hotel.com price was not a guarantee so I was charged more. Although I had my email showing the price, the man continued to argue with me about the additional dollar and would not budge. It took all of 15 minutes to check into the hotel and the room was seedy. Cigarette burn on the toilet... Outdated and pretty much with the price we paid.

The atmosphere is modern, sleek, and energetic. This place is great whether you are dining with a big group or with a date. I've tried many of the dishes here, but my favorites are (for appetizers) the tuna crudo, the PEI mussels, and the fried clams. The pizzas are OK -- nothing incredibly special, but still good. Try the pine nut pesto or the italian sausage, and you can never go wrong with the margherita pizza. The entrees here are good, but they may have changed the menu since I last went. I loved the salmon and they used to have an amazing steamed halibut dish that was to die for. Desserts and drinks are delicious here too - extensive, impressive wine list, fantastic, gorgeous cocktails (I recommend the pomegranate mojito). All in all, this is a great place to try -- I would recommend some of the other Concentrics restaurants before this one (like One Midtown Kitchen, Two Urban Licks, Murphy's, Trois), but if you're in the Atlantic Station area, it's worth a visit.",pos

Unfortunately this stay much much shorter:(.We arrived just about when complementary wine hour began. Had just enough time to get to our room, freshen up and have a couple of glasses of vino. I enjoyed the merlot while my DH have the white (didn't notice what kind). The red was wonderful!Our room was nice and very clean. The only issue was the mini bar fridge wasn't working. After notifying the front desk, they sent someone right on it while we were out for dinner.Morning coffee is excellent, however I wish coffee was in the room for better convenience. Thank goodness I had someone willing to go downstairs and get some to bring back to the room.While staying, there were two weddings going on and lots of people dressed in suits and so on... I felt a little intimidated only because we weren't dressed to the nines. While sitting in wine hour, the lobby got very crowded and loud with the wedding parties but we were able to score a spot, find a place for dinner and do a little yuppie watching.All in all, this place is great! The location can't be beat and it's not too pretentious.",pos
If in the area again will stay again.,pos
"Really like this place! Only one negative... They hold the entire stay plus a bit more when you check in. Which was fine until we checked out and they charge you the bill, which was 460.00 but another 600.00 was held in addition. Didnt really like them tying up the money for another 3-5 days. It was okay for us but I know it could mess people up if they were on a tight budget. What if we had needed it for the rest of our trip or lost our cash... We travel ALOT and I have never had a hotel do this. Too bad because we really liked the place and the people. It is an older building but more spacious than the Hilton. Hope they rework this policy.",pos

Really Convenient location, was a ways from the event but closer motels were already full. We decided to stay an extra night but the front desk said they were full. Went online and several rooms were available online for this motel. Train you front desk people. They lost a room sale because we ended up booking at a motel very close by for lots less.",pos

"We stopped in this motel on the way between SF and LA around 7pm. There were complimentary 3 kinds of cheese, tea, coffee, cakes. The breakfast is good and there is no need to go to restaurants instead: cookies, juices, tea, coffee, eggs, cheese, etc. Walking distance to marina where live sea elephants and you will find many shops and restaurants. I avoid the use of conditioners and for fresh air in night, I opened the small window in the bathroom and the door therein. That small window opens into the spacious hall (like atrium) with cool pleasant air. I am not sure whether the big outer window could be opened but I had no need doing that.",pos

Close to the casino which was nice!",avg
"Overall it has the appearance of a nice place, however it is clear that they don't have money to fix or clean. Mildew in the shower is not excusable, refrigerator cabinets devoid of a fridge. The pool was freezing because some customer 'turned off the heat' so they could swim laps, that really isn't excusable as the hotel pool should be for the majority of guests. Please someone clean the pool area and the 'skylight' area which appeared cobweb-spider infested and hasn't been cleaned ... ever. The exercise room was actually nice as was the bar area/restaurant. Hotelscom lists the place as having a breakfast buffet and included it in price, however the 'hotel wouldn't honor it' and the manager said they NEVER do buffets on the weekend (but on Sunday it was there at 11.95 adults and 6.95 children) - scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage and hash browns (which were actually home fries, cubes potatoes with onions) and a few muffins. What other places would give you for free. That was disappointing. However I give hotelscom credit for contacting the hotel and setting the record and price straight. Just messed the morning plans as I wasn't going to shell out 40 for a awful breakfast that they were supposed to include (it's the premise of it). Would I stay again Hmm... given there are other options in the area, the pool and room wasn't good I'd go to a Hilton Garden Inn (free cookies.. nice rooms), and though this place said they had cookies I never saw them.",avg

"My main beef was ,.. The room was extremely small and was not the one I booked per the picture. I had to go in sideways into the bathroom and though things are small in general in Europe, the localization and the price I paid for this hotel room justifies a bigger bathroom door in the very least. Though the breakfast was varied and they do speak English, they could not make (regardless of language spoken), I am fluent in 2 and also speak some italian, they could not figure out how to make scrambled eggs!! Oh they had them, the ones you make from powder. Anywho, the staff is kind of uptight, though they play it like if they are actually being friendly. Other than that, and the extreme price 350 per night, the hotel was exceptionally well located. Train station and Duomo and Piazzas are all like 3 minutes to 5 away in each direction. There are plenty restaurants and stores and attractions + tours to make your stay in Florence a memorable one.",avg

"This was our first holiday (flight and hotel stay) with our nearly 3 yrs old. From our point of view it was really good as their is plenty to do in and just outside of the hotel complex. The swimming pool had a seperate toddler pool and the larger pools also had a shallow end which was quite safe for them. We stayed in a deluxe room and was not disappointed. We stayed self catering so did not use the restaurant at all but talking to other guests it was ok. I had a look at the breakfast one morning and it looked good. The surrounding areas which are in easy walking distance had a great choice of bars and restaurant's and it was nice to walk out every evening to wander round. The shops were all pretty much what you would expect from a Spanish resort area (mostly gift shops) but there were plenty of small supermarkets dotted around so it was easy to just pop out on foot to get some supplies. The evening entertainment was quite good and the kids loved it. But I'm not sure I would have liked to be staying right next to it as it went on quite late and if you were trying to sleep a child it would be impossible. My only bad point was the pool area, far too small for the amount of guests and sunbeds they have. You had to navigate your way around as everyone was squashed in, and the stairs to the beach bar (which was good) was often semi blocked by sunbathers! Would I go back No, as nothing was excellent just good but dont get me wrong we really had a good time.",pos

And no, we did not have the keys by phones or magnets or anything like that - the keys worked fine for the pool and side doors, etc. It was just our room door that had issues.",avg
"We stayed last minute while passing through to New Mexico. I asked for a quiet room and explained to the guy I am a chronic complainer of night noise. He chose to put us in a room with a shared door, under a bunch of high schoolers who jumped on the bed until midnight (because they woke me up) and loud lobby noise (which went away around 10:30). I heard every faucet being turned on, every thing the neighbors said and every door close and open. I think the walls between the rooms were an illusion because they certainly didn't block anything except who was in the room next door. It was of course the last room and we were so incredibly road weary. We to stuck with it. And the room smelled like someone had just gone in there and let one rip. Must have seeped through the imaginary walls.",neg

The Tidewater Inn is a good place to stay if you are looking for a comfortable bed to come back to after a day of sightseeing or at the beach.

No breakfast is included but you can get breakfast at the diner on site or in other restaurants nearby. Hyannis also has enough places to offer for breakfast.,avg
I was extremely disappointed! When I made this reservation it was for a one bedroom suite with 1 king bed and 1 king sofa bed. When I checked in the bed was a queen size.

Christmas in Mexico was an interesting choice for our family but after arriving at the Pueblo Bonito Sunset Beach it was the right choice. It offered each family member an experience of a lifetime. The hotel was clean and beautiful. The staff was friendly and efficient. I am not sure if they added extra golf carts for the holiday but the longest we had to wait was 10 minutes. As far as being harassed by time share people we were fortunate enough not to be approached. Although we could not swim at the beach it still was a very clean beach and we enjoyed many hours there.

Great location for Canyon De Chelly. It is just a short distance to the Visitor's Center and is central to the view points.

"This hotel is not a bad choice for a one night stay. The room was clean but is quite bare in terms of amenities. Although there was a small refrigerator, there was no coffee/tea maker. The front desk staff was abrupt and not particularly welcoming.",avg
This place is creepy. Weird tunnels and sterile rooms. AC shuts off when you're not activating motion sensors in room. Like Raccoon City.,neg

"We'd stayed at this hotel before, a few years ago. But we knew it had closed down, so when I booked this room for the night, I had no idea it was the same place we'd stayed at before. This was a very small, very basic room. No frills of any kind no hair dryer, no iron/ironing board, shampoo, etc. Now that we know it's been reopened, we'll be sure not to book a room here again.",neg
There is an old part of the hotel and a newer part. We stayed in the older part that was slightly tired and in need of some reservations to bathrooms and general fittings. The new part looked much better and with nicer finishes.,pos

In retrospect, I would have used your Hotel one night and stayed outsides the main city. Then too Expedia and night 3...did not use it and Expedia will never ever be used again. You would have let me cancel the 3rd night except for Expedia which was out of your control. Destination weddings are most certainly not to be done again. The wedding was not in your facility and as a retired Lutheran Minister the wedding gets a very low rating. Oh well, what is done is done.",pos

"Wonderful hotel in a great location. The eclectic and stylish Kimpton decor is a treat, both in the room and in public areas. Immaculately clean. Attentive staff.Location is unexpectedly fantastic. King street Alexandria can be toured on foot end to end, full of boutiques and restaurants. Alexandria has historic homes and the riverfront parks, plus the running/cycle path from DC to Mount Vernon runs right through it.Also worth noting is you are in DC in 15 mins by car, or you can take the free shuttle down king street to the metro.The only minor complain is a noisy AC in the room, and thats nitpicking really.",pos
We stayed at the Atlantic House during a bike trip. The staff was really friend and welcoming. Our room had a great ocean view. The beds were firm and I had a great night. It was walking distance to several good restaurants,pos
Loved it. Relaxing get away,pos
The staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel has a wonderful view of the beach and you can see the fireworks from the balcony. The bathroom could have been a little cleaner but the room was overall clean. The beds were definitely comfortable. The door that separates the two rooms were unlocked unfortunately. The people in the other room opened our door and of course we were not expecting someone walking through that door since it is normally locked. I did not bother to check if it was locked when we first got to the room. I just assumed it was always locked. Lesson learned for sure.,pos
RUDELY AWAKENED BY CLEANING STAFF AT 8 AM WHO KEPT BANGING ON AND JIGGLING THE DOOR CAUSING TJE ALLEGED SAFETY LATCH TO COME OFF. SCARED ME OUT OF MY SLEEP. WHY ON EARTH THEY CAME AT 8:00 WHEN CHECK OUT ISN'T UNTIL 11:00 Won't stay here again!!!!!,neg

I would have liked to have seen a dog station outside a few irresponsible pet owners left dog feces on the property, shame on them....... If I had to ask one thing of Best Western, please replace the mattresses or box springs every time our kids moved at night or my wife and I shifted the coils and springs were LOUD!!!!!! I would stay here again if passing through but not fr more then a night.",avg
"This was once the premier hotel in Fond du Lac, however, it is trapped in 1993 and can't get out. This is a shame because the bed was comfortable, the room was clean,  and only a few touch ups (see photos) could make it nice again. Try the Holiday Inn Express next store, news hotel.",avg

The unit leaked water onto the carpet and showed signs of having been ""patched"" with aluminum foil.",avg

Very nice stay and the room comfort was top notch. All at a great price.,pos
"The front desk did not acknowledge us even when we wanted to check in, and did not acknowledge us for the entirety of our stay, the only time they even bothered to look up from their phones or laptops was when my boyfriend walked in with his Navy Uniform, they thanked him for his service and continued whatever they were doing. The woman who cleaned our room was very friendly, and our room was cleaned every day of our stay, regardless of what time we left the hotel. The tub had a hard time draining, but all other appliances worked well. The room only smelled strange when the AC was left off for too long. The area is next to a couple of small shopping centers. Over all, it was not a terrible stay but I will probably not be returning.",avg

Fantastic. We really enjoyed the great Hospitality and warmth. Must come back to Istanbul Radison Blu. 90 Great!,pos
this hotel was great the young lady at the front desk was able to check me in 3 hours early! I drove in during a snowstorm managed to make it in early and was able to get into a room immediately that almost never happens anywhere else! the hotel is clean very large rooms spacious and accommodating the bed slept amazingly well! the breakfast was great the staff was very friendly and helpful didn't matter who or what time of the day I went down to speak with them. my only negative thoughts on the property would be the Direct TV crystal clear skies we had no signal off and on all day on the History Channel. the other negative would be park in the parking lot is very tiny however there is overflow parking across the street and that was not too big of a hassle. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone needing to stay in that area.,pos

"Lobby employee was the rudest and most unprofessional person I've ever encountered at a motel. While paying, he was arguing with another guest and holding my credit card. I was so frightened by his aggressiveness, I went to car and found another location to stay at. I believe he was under the influence. Hotels.com employee, Mar, told me I would have to call motel manager, Nikki on Monday to get a refund. I will never use either company again.",neg
"The hotel was nicely located in a center of the town. We pre-ordered breakfast buffe and dinner buffes, they were ok, remind me of Vikingline buffe. One thing that I wonder was hotel did not offer any transport to/from the airport. I read somewhere that there is a transport.",pos
We stayed here for our honeymoon with our two young children. The hotel location is lovely but not ideal to take young children. Better for 'older' people really.,pos
Ci siamo trovati ottimamente ed era giusta la location per andare all'EXPO con il servizio BUS-Navetta messo a disposizione Ottimo anche la ristorazione.,pos
The staff right from the beginning was very friendly. Our room was clean and very comfortable. We used the pool and hot tub which both were a good time. Was beyond surprised at the free breakfast that came with the room it wasn't your normal continental breakfast but a actual meal very happy with that. Over very satisfied with my stay would recommend to others and will be staying again in the future.,pos

"We stayed two nights here over Labor Day weekend for our visit to Astoria and Seaside. It is reasonably close to both locations (within 45 min and an hour of each) and was significantly more affordable than any hotels in our destination cities. The rooms were clean and all amenities were in working order. The tv had cable, though it was not a new flat screen. The continental breakfast provided sausage patties, homemade biscuits and gravy, oatmeal, yogurt, waffles, juice, coffee, tea and cold cereal. Warm foods were kept in slow cookers and the breakfast area was in the front room. Reminded me a bit of a family housing lots of friends - very homey. Cleaning and towels were taken care of professionally. This was a good and pleasant stay at a budget price - not a pricey resort by any means, but quite comparable to Best Western and the like.",pos

Great Price. Did my first ski lesson there. Staff very knowledgeable and patient. Prices are very cheap compared to other ski resorts areas. I enjoyed the day there.,pos

The pool temperature was warm which was nice. The kids enjoyed the game room. Overall, a pretty nice place to stay.",avg
"Hotel staff was very attentive and pleasant, although, the front desk was not staffed unless called with the buzzer. The morning breakfast was very good. The staff seemed to do a good job of keeping the facility clean, but some of the hotel guests dumped their trash and dirty towels outside of room doors for pickup and vomit was present in the stairwell and outside the back door. The AC was difficult to moderate and would shut down due to energy saving measures when someone was not in the room. This caused the room to always take a period of time to get comfortable again. The entrance to and from the main road in front was not always easy.",pos
"Our wedding will be in August of 2016 and we are trying to plan about 8 months in advance. The service and responsiveness of the employees here was unbelievable. I received emails and calls within 30 minutes of my own, scheduled a tour, and received top notch service. The venue is beautiful and they allow you to make it your own. They encourage you to select vendors that you like are are comfortable with price-wise. They also guarantee the cost within around $100 of the total. Absolutely wonderful experience so far, and I'm excited to continue to work with them!",pos

There is a walking trail behind the hotel that runs right alongside the Mississippi River. Many trails to explore in the city. So many great restaurants a short drive away...Anton's is in an historic log cabin. The cheese curds were great at Grizzlie's. I had an excellent eggplant dish at Ciatti's Ristorante, also the mussels were fabulous. This was probably our best meal. These were all a few miles down Division Street. Don't forget the Green Mill restaurant next door. You can have room service, which I liked. We ate there three times. We have been here for eight days now and I've probably gained that many pounds.",pos

"This hotel should have a free breakfast included in his price. However, in the same building/s complex the Garcia restaurant is located causing a political issue. Not everyone is willing to pay a minimum of about 8.00 per person for a breakfast, especially families with young children that usually eat a handful of cereal with a glass of milk for this meal. For this remotely located hotel a free family breakfast would definitely be a great asset. Other than this it is a nice place to stay.",pos

The hotel was not in good conditions, it was not Clean so well, there were things missing, the toilet was not working well and we asked for help and the front desk person went to see the problem but he seemed like he was not willing to help, the beds were so hard and uncomfortable to sleep on, we didn't sleep much also the door, the lock was not working, we were concern and we didn't bother to tell the guy who was working that night because he said it was all booked he couldn't change us to another room. It was a nightmare.",neg

Other than the episode with the pillows, it was a pleasant stay.",pos
The breakfast buffet was a joke. There are maybe 4 tables in the dining area. This is a budget hotel and yet I paid over 100 per night. Ridiculous! The room was mostly clean but the AC didn't have a thermostat and the whole hotel is a bit run down and drab. Not the kind of place I would want to stay.

We were able to have our entire wedding week held at The Abbey Resort. It was so convenient for our guests to attend all events at one location- from the rehearsal, rehearsal dinner, ceremony, cocktail hour and reception. The Harbor Gazebo, our ceremony site, was beautifully maintained. The white chairs provided were classy and appropriate. The Harbor Ball Room was beautiful! We were thrilled with the timeliness of table setup prior to our event. We were happy with quality of linens, napkins, and table placings. The layout of the room, specialty tables and bars was functional and easy to navigate. The food was exceptional, just as we remembered from our menu tasting. The quality and choice of beverages were great. We were excited to be able to offer our family and friends favorite drink options throughout the evening. Tabitha Bell, our event planner and manager was exceptional! Her energy, charisma and bubbly personality made every interaction a pleasure! Tabitha was professional, on the ball and offered her expert opinion that aided in creating the wedding of our dreams. She provided AMAZING recommendation for outside wedding vendors and definitely did NOT steal us wrong! Lisa Colbert, the Avani Spa Wedding Coordinator, was wonderful to work with. She and the stylists, make up artists and nail technicians provided quality work, spending extra time on each of the members of our wedding party, making sure no one felt rushed!Claire Roddy, our hotel booking manager, was a pleasure to work with.

It's not the fanciest hotel but the staff was friendly and the room we stayed in had everything we needed: a comfortable bed, a shower with working hot water (though the pressure wasn't the best), free wifi, and a Keurig to make coffee. Each day in the lobby they also provide guests with infused water and unlimited coffee. We were planning on eating breakfast in the hotel one morning, but with so many great brunch places in the area we ended up eating out each day. One thing that visitors should be aware of is that they place a 50 hold on your card for incidentals. I was a little worried this would be an issue, but about a week after our trip, the hold was removed and no additional charges were added on my account. The hotel itself is a bit hard to find at first because it is hidden behind a Bone Daddy's restaurant on the front and the back of the hotel faces a residential area which made it hard for Google Maps to give us good directions. Despite the trouble finding it when we first got there, we enjoyed our stay enough that the Hilton Garden Inn is our new place to stay when we visit Austin.",pos

"Have stayed in this motel every couple of years and it has gone done in the following respects, though the room accommodation remained good: 1)Housekeeping personnel and desk-clerk and manager, always kept someone smoking within five-feet of the entrance/ext. Annoying. 2)In the past the Continental Breakfast was nicely presented. Not this time. Had to ask for one thing and thing another, calling the desk-clerk to leave the lounge chair more than once, rather than his surveying the kitchen to see what else may be lacking. 3)At the top of the stairs cigarette smoke-smells were prevalent, though I had a non-smoking room. Though not overpowering, my room had the scent of the same. I will not stay there again on my next trip in two years.",neg

"The first room I was assigned (#142) had the door broken in and was open. So I asked for a new room, so they gave me RM # 314. The room was very dirty.  The wall, curtains, carpet and bed linens were grossly dirty. The security Chain on the door was gone. There was hair in the bath tube and grime around the tube, toilet and sink. The kitchen was also filthy. There were no hangers in the closet. I asked the front desk for some, but they never arrived. Although I was staying there for 4 nights, there was one towel and no wash rags. No waste basket in the bathroom. NO BODY EVER CAME TO CLEAN THE ROOM OR MAKE THE BED OR CHANGE THE SHEETS. There was music and noise most of the night. I asked the lady at the desk if she had ever been in one of the rooms to see how dirty they are. She said No. I asked the Security Guard on nights at the desk how often they get broken into, he said ""Not too many"". Yet I see that room 142 had a new door replaced the day after and that there were multiple new doors throughout the complex.I would never stay there or recommend this place to anyone.",neg

"We were here for 2 nights. It is a decent hotel for the price and breakfast was a plus. Workout area and pool area was nice to have. Upon arrival the front desk attendant was having trouble with the computer. I had to wait a good 30 minutes to check in. This wouldn't have been so terrible if I didn't have 4 heavy bags, and an infant with me. It was also late at night, so of course I just wanted to put my son back to bed. The breakfast was ok. The eggs were a little watery the first morning. The microwave dial was sticky when I went to use it for the first time. I stayed there 2 nights and the 2nd day my key did not work. And as far as I could tell, others did not either. I had to again carry my infant son back down the front desk, and he was awoken from his nap because of this. The TV did not work the second evening I stayed here. It was supposedly not from the hotel but a cable provider issue.",avg

"I was traveling with my grandchildren, so I choose this hotel because it had an outdoor pool. Upon arrival, I saw the pool had no water, greatly disappointing my grandkids. Upon check-in, I waited while the woman at the desk finished her personal call. When commenting on the pool, she still didn't even look up and her response was a shrug and off-the-cuff comment, ""the pool had a leak"". Not even an apology or smile. She then asked if I wanted to go elsewhere. I replied that I had prepaid through Hotels.com and got another shrug. This was the good part of the stay. The room was large, but the bedspeads were dirty and sliding door disgusting with a makeshift drilled hole with a screw instead of a lock. The wallpaper was patched and horribly peeling in the bathroom. The bathroom was dirty as well, especially the floor. Thank goodness the stay was only overnight.",neg

Staff are very helpful and the restaurant next door a good choice for breakfast. There are adequate gym facitlities for a hotel and a decent pool.

We were given a room on the 1st floor by the spa area. It was very loud. There were people up late talking. The beds were uncomfortable and each bed only had 3 little square pillows. Around 8:30pm a whole bus of people came took up what seemed to be the whole second floor. They were very loud. Then around 6am that whole bus of people all left and once again were loud inconsiderate of the people sleeping. We were also next to stairs so you could hear them trying to roll/drop their suitcase all the way down the stairs talking loud. I would pay to stay at a better place next time. The only thing that gave this hotel edge over others was it is walking distance from the Marina Dunes State Beach we watched the sunset into the ocean with our family.,neg

The air conditioners/heaters in the nearby rooms were so loud, that their cycling on an off through the night made it almost impossible to get a good night's sleep. The continental breakfast was not good. There was no butter or margarine for the toast. Coffee was weak and only one type of artificial sweetener.",neg

They did have any queen or king bed rooms available only double rooms even though I had a reservation for a king bed room.  All they did to compensate for it was offer us a free continental breakfast which is just coffee and pastries.  I asked for a refund for our room since I had already paid for it and the guy behind the desk said he couldn't help me with that since I booked it on Expedia.  We ended up walking down the street in 10 degree weather to another hotel owned by the same franchise.  When I told them what happened they at least apologized and the lady behind the desk even offered to email Expedia for me to get my refund which is what the first guy should have done.  I'm not sure if all hotels oversell their rooms but I would not recommend this hotel for that reason.,neg

When looking at venues, we knew this was going to be the perfect loaction for us as they also offer packages where you can book the entire place for the whole weekend (including all 19 rooms). When you have a lot of out of town guests, that's an important factor. And the location of the Inn is so convenient to other hotels if more rooms are needed. It is also within walking distance of bars, restaurants, museums, etc. David, the owner, was absolutely fantastic to work with! Phenomenal customer service!!

Started in a room that initially we liked. As my wife was prep for bed the smell of tobacco started to bother her coming from the desk. She called about the situ and was told that we could move to a handicapped room. Did not want that.

We found the first room assigned to us to be occupied when we opened the door, which we fortunately realized immediately. We were assigned a nearby room, but our keys suddenly stopped working after 2 days. We will not stay here again, even though it seems to be the cheapest option in the area.

We told the reception about this and they said they sent a bellboy to spray the bathroom. Unfortunately, this only drove the ants from the bathroom into our bedroom and they got into our luggage and beds. The ants even bit us on our legs and arms! We asked the front desk if we could change rooms but they were completely booked. Since we had a to catch an early morning train, we couldn't talk to the manager. If you can get a room that's ant-free, you'll like this hotel. The breakfast is great, views are spectacular, staff are friendly and it's a short ferry ride to Bellagio too.",avg

The spa pool was closed for renovations and was told we could use the normal indoor pool (...duh- everyone can use the normal indoor pool...) however, when we went to use the pool they had rented it out to local kids for swimming lessons. There were 25 kids swimming, picking their noses and butts (no really, i'm not kidding or being sarcastic), and jumping around kicking us in the hot tub as well. Not the birthday spa experience I paid 300 for. When customers are unhappy, don't offer to transfer their reservation to another hotel farther away. That doesn't solve the problem- at all. It just seems like you want to send your unhappy customers to someone else to deal with. I loved this place before, but after the last time I will never be going back. Way to disappoint.",pos

The location is very nice-just 3 blocks from Bourbon Street. There is a lot of construction going on in front of the hotel but didn't affect our stay. Staff was very nice and the breakfast had a nice variety. The elevator is extremely small-my husband and i with 3 suitcases filled it up. The bathroom layout was very odd. A large bathroom but the sink was outside the bathroom. There was only 1 small light in the bathroom and made the shower area very dark. The shower had NO water pressure at all. The pillows in the room were very uncomfortable and was like sleeping on tiny little rocks. Did not get a good night sleep. Overall wouldn't stay again unless there wasn't another choice.,avg

"Awesome couple - if it wasn't for Janie and Ed, I don't know what I would have done. This was a bucket list vacation for my mother who is 94 yrs old, grew up in the area and is now starting into dementia/alzheimer's . Our care-taker came too so we could spell each other in keeping an eye on Mom. I just loved the location and how quiet it was - the expectations were posted in the room - kind of like Mom's rules at home, of put it back where you found it, clean up the kitchen before...view more you leave, put the dishes and silverware and electronic things (toaster, coffee pot, fans, etc.) back how you found them. All I can say is that some of their guests must be pigs - if the rules say to do something and the guest doesn't do it, it is NOT a reflection on the motel owners. I can never repay the kindness and understanding of Ed and Janie. They truly bent over backwards to make our stay as comfortable as possible. All of the condiments were in the cupboard we needed, same with dish soap, the towels and wash cloths were so soft and absorbent. If we had a question or needed anything, we just popped over to their house and asked. Simple as that. Was it perfect like a chain motel, no, but I wasn't expecting it to be perfect, I was expecting exactly what we got. Just like home - well lived in and comfortable. The recliner got a lot of use, the mattress's on the beds were comfortable. What more could anyone ask for Janie baked us an Apple pie with ice cream the night before we left - how many motel owners have you had do that for youview less",pos

I had to climb under the sink to shut off the water (CA drought conditions!). Staff seemed indefferant on the morning, saying Why didn't you call us at 10:30 pm. No adjustment on the bill, of course. Miserable experience and we will never stay there again.",neg

"The Octagon Inn is the perfect place to stay on the San Juan River. I have stayed at several places over the years and the Octagon was by far the easiest stay I have ever had. It has everything you need from nice sleeping arrangements, to full kitchen, to outdoor gas grills, and a great patio to sit and visit with friends over a cocktail after a great day of fishing. I would recommend the guiding service as well. My buddy and I came down to the San Jaun River from Portland, OR and Matt put us on fish the whole week we were there. It was actually when I hooked and landed a nice Rainbow on the first cast of the first day that I knew I was in good hands.",pos

When checking in, I inquired until what time breakfast was served and was informed 10:30am the next morning (Monday).We had a wonderful dinner at the hotel's restaurant and then went to the concert. We took our time getting ready the next morning thinking that breakfast was served until 10:30am. We got to the breakfast area at 10am and the area was closed. When I stated that I had been told that breakfast was served until 10:30, I was informed that that was on the weekend. The staff was very nice and offered us fruit and juice but we really wanted to have breakfast so we then checked out...very disappointing! It would have been a four star getaway except for the breakfast miscommunication.",avg

The cleaning of the room was below average with areas up high not cleaned and snot not cleaned off of the wall next to the toilet at eye level. This is not something you want to see. It makes you think if they are not cleaning things of this nature what else are they not doing.,neg
"Duct tape repair on bottom (inside) of tub. Wash cloth frayed and had holes. Bed sheet, while seemingly laundered, did have a blood stain on it. Fiber blanket felt extremely dirty. Broken toilet base repaired with caulk (instead of replacing the toilet). Shower curtain rod hanging loose. Tile floor dirty - Carpet unknown. Crack between door jamb big enough for ANY bug/rodent to come in. HVAC unit created a urine-like smell in the room. Bedside phone did not work. Clearly no actual cleaning ever took place in this room (202) - just changing towels and linens.",neg
"We have stayed here in the past, and it was always ok, but this stay was disappointing. First of all, we arrived a little early and wanted to go to the park. We were told a room was ready, but we'd have to pay a 25 early check in (what the heck!) Never heard of this before. We decided to pay because we wanted to go on the park for the day and wanted to get the food water out of the hot car. Also, the room wasn't exactly clean... It was cleanish, but not exactly clean... The hotel ice machines were broken, then we were sent to the office (per housekeeping) to get ice, and they were out... Not cool. It was a hot weekend, and all of their ice machines weren't working Hmmm... Their continental breakfast was terrible. All they had was undercooked waffles, two kinds of cereal, tiny muffins and bread for toast... All carbs... no protein whatsoever, and no fruit. Not exactly a healthy breakfast. The whole hotel looked awful. They definitely need to invest money into their hotel to make it look smell better. Sadly, that was our last stay at this Travelodge. We stayed at the Super 8 down the road recently, they at least offer fruit and yogurt for breakfast (along with a variety of other pastries, waffles, and cereals), and they're in the process of remodeling. We'll be staying there from now on.",neg

Breakfast was very nice too! Hotel has charming feeling, and staff was vey friendly. The only issue I had, was the fan/AC noise, from unit of the room. As I was sleeping right next to it, and I am also a very light sleeper...turned it off one night, and then no problems to sleep. Also noticed the street noise, like garbage truck, can be a nuisance if your room is on the street side like ours. Recommend this !",pos
"Just returned from a week at the Hotel Elba Sara with my 16 year old daughter, very happy with the hotel, very clean and food was great, wide variety. One little thing we were disappointed with, was our flight was an evening departure and while we understood that the hotel was busy and late check out was but possible but no courtesy room was available even for an hour to shower etc, we ended up showering in the gym and trying to pack out last bits into the suitcase on the foyer floor, not ideal, give the calibre of the hotel this just let it down Hotel is located a bit outside the resort, nothing much in the vicinity, shops bars etc about 15 mins walk or 3,50euro in a taxi.",pos

The bathroom was a bit on the small size though and needs a little updating and maintenance. The swimming pool appears nice, but small. The pool room was too cool for us to take a dip. We would have frozen once we got out. The breakfast was the standard hot fare - instant eggs, sausage, biscuits, waffles, apples, bananas, oranges, yogurt, cereal, juice, and coffee. Our 3rd morning there, i noticed numerous ants on the table where the coffee was. i told the breakfast lady, who cleaned it up.",pos

When we visited the Bar/Grill, we were seated in the dining area, without any TV's. The World Series game was on and we wanted to watch the game while we had dinner and some drinks. We asked our waitress if we could sit in the bar area and if we could order some food. She said absolutely. So we moved into the bar area. The bartender came over and took our order. When she brought us our drinks, we asked about the free drink. She said sorry, you have to sit in the dining area. We told her that the game is on, there are no TV's in the dining room, and we wanted to watch the game while we dined and had some drinks. She said sorry. When we checked out, I mentioned to the concierge what happened last night, her response was, you needed to sit in the dining room. I explained to her about the game being on and that we could have ordered food in the dining area and then we could have moved to the bar area, what's the difference. Plus I just dropped over 600 staying here. Plus, your manager Gabriel didn't mention anything about dining room only, he said here is an offer for a complimentary drink. She said yeah, sorry, you needed to be in the dining area. Very poor customer service on her part. Reason for my low rating overall. The facility has a very nice view of Harbor Island though. Lots of choices to choose from with our future visits to Harbor Island.",avg

Room had holes in the walls, bed was sinking in the middle, there were hairs all over the room and we found what looked like dog poop on the side of the bed. We stayed here years ago and loved how close to the beach it was but I wish we would have done some research and stayed elsewhere this trip.",neg

For the extremely reasonable price (75 Euro for a double), I was expecting your typical tiny hotel room basically a bed, a toilet and a shower. I was Pleasantly surprised! The room and bathroom were very spacious. The bed was comfortable, the free breakfast buffet had more selections than I have seen anywhere and the staff was extremely friendly. It was within a 10 minute walk to the train station making downtown Berlin very accessible. I highly recommend staying here and if my family and I find ourselves heading to Berlin again we will book at the Comfort Hotel Bernau. More",pos

As far as the noise level. you could can definitely hear your neighbors come and go, but i live in hotels pretty much and that happens at the 5 star ones too!! i didnt think there were that many disruptions at all.. and i stayed on the 4th of July!!! did i fly slow motion into the fluffiest bed in the world absolutley not! But i didn't pay an extra 50 to 100 dollars for a fluffy bed either.

"This all inclusive has some odd policies. You have to sign restaurant style tickets for everything you do. Every water, beer, meal, everything it gets old fast. Everytime to hit the swim up bar it's another ticket to sign. We stayed at over 15 all inclusive resorts in the last 12 years first time I've ever seen this. I mean isn't this the point of the wrist band!! No mini bad in room. No bottled water, beer, soda not even in room coffee... Also ran in to some pretty rude staff. I've been told no so many times at a resort before. I will never stay here again.",avg

Had to walk a 50 yard hall to get to room because keypad was not working on outside door. No outside lighting next to rooms. (It wouldn't be safe to go your car or outside for any reason) Ice machine was not working on my side of the building so had to go to other side just to get ice. I spoke to someone who said both were in disrepair not long ago and guests had to go to the gas station to get bags of ice. Couldn't speak to room staff (they didn't speak any English). Was woken many times by other rooms using water.,neg
"The room was clean, comfortable and nicely decorated. Fantastic views from the balcony! The staff were really helpful in recommending places to visit and things to do.The road was close but caused us no disturbance. The staff were also helpfull and friendly. The only thing that let our stay down was the meal we had at the hotel on our first night and we didn't have dinner there again. The meal was very over priced and unfortunately the most expensive but worst meal of our holiday. My husband ordered lobster which hadn't been cleaned properly and I was disappointed with my order. There were plenty of other places to eat in town which was only a 10 minute walk and we found the food much better in the restaurants there. The nearest beach was clean, quiet (at the end of July) and beautiful although if you hire a car there are plenty of other similar beaches within a reasonable distance. Recommend car hire to see more of the island but although the roads are in good condition be prepared for sharp corners on fast mountainous roads with sheer drops. If that doesn't put you off exploring by car is probably the best way to see this beautiful island with its stunning beaches",pos

For this reason and with a good rate, I booked the hotel.As is our practice, we bring wipes to clean the phone, door knobs, TV remote and bathroom etc. We found all of the above dirty.

I did not complain to the hotel because the were begining a remodel of the public bath which led me to believe their answer would be remodeling.",neg
"Great hotel, great breakfast, friendly staff, convenient location, and great rate. I was just stopping by for one night on a one-day business trip, but if I had to stay a week I would have stayed here. This category of hotel will spoil the traveler for what you receive for a low priced hotel. I will never understand why more expensive hotels don't offer this much.",pos

I'll admit was a bit concerned when I booked........However my wife and I were pleasantly surprised. Excellent staff and clean rooms. Rooms are of nice size comfy clean beds and linens.

However, we can say this resort is one of our favorites. It just does everything well. And it must be said that its easier on the budget than all the rest. Its also closer to the airport than most of our other resorts.

The room overlooks a quiet street which makes you feel at home. The bathroom is considered ok, but I was expecting a more modern one. The wall paper, at least in my room, was beautiful.

The hotel is right on the flight path but the double glazing is good so did not bother us. The airport closes about 11.30 but the last flights arrive and depart much sooner.

"I thought the hotel was beautiful. It is a very nice place to stay for younger people or people who do not have children. I say this because the surrounding area is really just filled with shops, bars and restaurants. There are no real attractions or things for children to do. Having children there was okay as the hotel does provide a children's time. If a person goes to DC to visit the Mall and the museums, I would suggest they stay closer to those attractions. Other than that, the area is beautiful and the restaurants were nice and the hotel was great. My only complaint of the hotel was there was a faint scent of urine at the door.",pos

hotel was close to the plant I was working at. The room was clean and the staff were helpful and friendly. For people who want to work out the hotel has a couple of memberships to the Anytime Fitness which is about 50 feet from the front door of the hotel. Also the there are two restaurants within walking distance which have decent food. Only down side was the morning breakfast. If you didn't get there when it was put out it was usually gone by 7:00 am and not restocked.,avg

"Hotel was generally excellent. Sea view rooms looked great. Our room was on the side and had a terrible view of unsightly side of hotel next door. On reflection we should have asked to be moved but didn't bother as only there for a couple of days would definitely be worth paying more for the stunning view of port and cathedral. Had breakfast one day which was very good but quite expensive at 29 per person-would have been cheaper if we had included breakfast when we booked. Room facilities v good. Good wifi in room, lovely bed. Quite a long walk into town but very easy to hail a taxi if needed and not expensive at around 5. Would go back.",pos

"I was late in looking for a hotel near my son's college for family weekend, so my search was narrowed down to about 8 hotels a half an hour away.  I read the reviews and this seemed to receive the best comments.  We found the hotel to be clean and fine for our purposes, which was basically somewhere to watch tv after dinner and go to sleep. The bathroom was somewhat outdated but clean. The front office staff was great- the first night we were greeted warmly by the young woman, and my checkout was handled efficiently by the gentleman at the desk the next morning.  There were a number of restaurants and stores nearby for somewhere to walk around after dinner.  We even decided that we would probably stay at this hotel the next time because we were able to save so much more money than if we had stayed at an overpriced motel closer to the college!",pos

I can't tell you how the room was, because when we arrived we were informed that they had overbooked it. We ended up in a very ordinary, very small room, which was all that was available. Since we made a reservation for a very specific room, I fail to understand how the hotel couldn't have known that there was more than one reservation for it. They did give us a coupon for a free breakfast (a 25 value -- woohoo!) but the weekend was a big, big disappointment.",pos

"Hotel was OK. I'm used to staying in MUCH nicer hotels, but for a somewhat last minute trip and wanting to be close to the beach and center of town its what We settled for. The pool was decent and I think it was heated at night. The room was not the best, it was somewhere to sleep and put our stuff, is what it was. Nothing fancy or extra AT ALL. the sheets had a hole and they were not changed everyday. And there wasn't even an actual comforter on the bed. We had to febreeze it( it had a stale smell) and I wiped down the room myself when we got there.( for my own assurance) But we still stayed for 4 nights 5 days. We went to target,radio shack, a little grocery shopping and the mall (with Dave and busters) ect. and the furthest we ever drove was still less then 10 mins. And the beach and broad walk was a half a mile down the street. I personally would never choose to stay here again but it wasn't the worst either. Like I said it was somewhere to stay and so affordable (under our normal hotel budget) and location wise, it was great, we were in the middle of everything. We'll just say it wasn't nearly bad enough to get in the way of enjoying our vacation.",avg

This place was an absolute dump. Walls look as if they have never been cleaned. Couch was dust and dirt so thick on it. There was no toilet seat on the toilet. How the heck does that work.

They say oh we didn't see you had dogs and move me to a diffrent room. This is where i get the nasty I cleaned room with two single beds and no toilet seat with filth all over it smelled horrible. I left after being in there for less than 30 minutes. I would rather sleep in my car then be in there a minute longer. I can not believe the filth in that hotel.,neg
The rooms/suite at this hotel are individually owned and therefore NOT all rooms are created equally!!! Our room was very 'tired' looking in terms of decor. Curtains bedding could do with updating and the room would definitely benefit from a fresh coat of paint and some fresh updated wall art. The room was just 'OK' and worked out for a one night stay. We were dissaponted that the pool was not yet open as they were waiting on the state inspector to sign off. On chatting with the house keeper as cleaned the room next to ours she invited us to see inside. The room was slightly larger with two double beds (same as our room) but had the benefit of a sofa coffee table seating area. Bed linens were bright and modern looking. Very nice. I guess it's the luck of the draw as to which room you are assigned!,avg

To start with the location is a perfect one for visiting Florence - there is a single bus (7) that takes you right to within 5 minutes of the major attractions downtown. The bus stop is right next to the hotel, and the front desk will sell you bus tickets. And the view of Florence from the Fiesole hills is amazing. Fiesole itself is a great little town and well work a day of exploring as well. If you are in Fiesole, be sure to walk up the hill off of the main square for the even more stunning view of Florence. The hotel staff were wonderful, the room was perfect, and the breakfast (included in our rate) was terrific as well.",pos

The carpet was very old and several parts were torn. The room smelled like mold. Front desk service was very good. This was not a 2.5 star. It was terrible. I had a bad feeling when we pulled in and half the neon sign that says 'Hampton Inn' was out. I would not recommend this hotel.,neg

"I really appreciate the dependability of Hampton Inns - they are always clean, comfortable, reasonably priced, and the staff is helpful and friendly. At the Hampton Inn Dublin, I gave a four out of five for room comfort simply because we ended up with a room that seemed a little smaller than what we usually get at a typical Hampton Inn (but it was a full hotel with the Virginia Tech home game weekend and we do have 2 adults and 3 kids in our family!) and because the bed pillows didn't seem as numerous and as comfortable as we've come to expect (firstworldproblems, right). Overall, very satisfactory! The kids had fun in the indoor pool, everyone slept well and we were on our way to our destination the next morning after coffee and a tasty little breakfast :)",pos

"I have rarely made reviews a part of my travel experience. Although I am most greatful for fellow travelers who do as it helps me make selections. So when I do review its either steller or stinker. This is a thumbs down joint for multi family travelers. The suite is a room wt beds, one loo and no extra TP. The towels barely dried my feet and the AC wasn't efficient at its role in life for such an odd layout. If your looking for a place to lay your head with no cares this could be it. If you have your RV Palace his could be the camp for you. Don't believe any photos on the Net that show a pool, it got filled in years ago! All in all this was a dump, a huge dissapointment and I have opened an investigation wt Expedia to verify this (ever changing names) establishment is acting in full disclosure. Oh and the hot breakfast was toaster waffles removed from celophoane. Wow. Just so deciving!!",neg

"The front desk reception was friendly and very helpful in directing me to the hote and with my room assignment. The downside was when I requested a room change and was assigned to a room that appeared to have not been thoroughly cleaned. By this time, the shift had changed along with the customer service of the new person behind the front desk, who seemed to be very curt at a simple request for a tooth brush. The upside is that the breakfast was good, as was the service of the very courteous person who went out of her way to assure that everyone was taken care of.",avg

"I chose this hotel as a change to the 2 star hotel I have often stayed in, thinking it would be in a nice area and that it might offer a bit more luxury than the usual one near Republique. However although the area was ok, and there was a fabulous patisserie where you can get breakfast for half the price that the hotel offered, our bedroom was so small that you could barely open the door before you literally fell onto the first of 2 twin beds. You could also not walk around the second bed as there was barely enough room in order to reach the window or the small clothes rack in the far corner. It felt more like a box than a room. I was also given a code in order to access the free hotel wi-fi but at no point could I actually connect to it. I think I will be going back to the hotel near the Republique next time!",avg

"Stayed for 8 nights in a suite. Nice size room with full kitchen, washer dryer, huge tub, fireplace. TV was a little grainy, not that the TV was old I just think that the cable service was older or something. Looked like all the movies were from the 80's. Not that big of a deal, could have just been our room. No room service from the hotel, but I think local restaurants have a delivery service. With the full kitchen and close grocery stores it's not that big of a deal. Main Street is close but too far to walk to when it's freezing outside, and is the real hub of Park City. I understand the buses are free and arrive every 10min. but in well below freezing temps. 10min. Is a long time. We rented a truck at the airport so no issues there. The immediate area around the resort has all the essentials, rentals, couple restaurants and bars, sporting stores etc... but for real shopping for gifts and a huge choice of places to eat, main street is where you'll end up going. This is the best place to stay if your planning on riding at Park City Mountain Resort. When I come back to Park City I will be staying here.",pos

I feel like we were racially profiled. My kids where not acting bad or anything be cause I have control over them. But for some reason this women who was in the pool area with us decided she was going to tell the manager that we were all over the pool! Really! Like she had to have the whole pool to her self. The manager came in and told us that we had to get out and let other people have the pool. Anyways to make a long story short.we will NEVER go back there again!!,neg

"We stayed at this property to attend an event about 20 miles away. It's close to the highway, which was convenient for us. Room was quite comfortable and had relatively new furnishings. However, upon arrival we were greeted by a large roll away bed standing on end (i.e., it blocked part of the entry and wouldn't have fit in room if it were set up). When I went to front desk to see about having it removed, I had to wait about 10 minutes for desk person who apparently was only staff person on duty and was working desk and dealing with room issues - she went with me to room to remove bed. Also, lobby was a little iffy - lobby restroom was not clean and, there was a carpet runner in the lobby that was really several pieces of leftover wall-to-wall remnants that had been hand cut - a bit tacky and a tripping hazard. Finally, a couple had a huge, screaming fight in the middle of the night, which I found quite disturbing because I was concerned it could turn violent - not hotel's fault but still...

All in all the loaction was great and so was everything else I would stay there again for the price and location just don't stay in room 350 because you will have an extra guest.,avg

The room was relatively clean however the shower was very dirty with mold in the grout. It was pretty disgusting. I purchased bathroom spray with bleach and a couple of sprays here and there did the trick. I can't understand how they didn't see this or take any action.,pos

Seemingly characterless hotel but the location makes up for it. We stayed one night and the room was clean but the double bed was 2 singles moved together. Staff were great and location is fantastic,pos
Very romantic,pos
Motel staff was friendly and helpful. There seemed to be a lot of vagrants but I never felt unsafe. The room definitely needed deeply cleaned. The pool was very nice as the courtyard. I would stay here again as the price was economical.,neg

"Me and my boyfriend stayed at this hotel for two nights. I was hesitant at first from reading previous reviews.. but we had a delightful stay! We had a king size bed which was very comfortable. No issues checking in since we are 19. The room was clean, we got sick during our stay and threw up all over the bed and floor and room service had no problems cleaning everything up. Good distance from the beach.. not that close but a few blocks down. I would definitely stay here again.",pos

"I still can't believe how wonderful my wedding day was, and it was in large part due to the facility and staff at the Garden of the Gods Club. First, the location and scenery is INCREDIBLE, people look at my wedding pictures and have a hard time believing they are not photoshoped or altered, everything was unreal! You could honestly feel the love in the air, the scenery for the ceremony was perfect, all the guest rooms that people stayed in were beautiful, the cocktail hour was well run, good bar and great food and the reception was great, amazing food, a sit down dinner for over 200 people, and everyone was happy and well attended to. Rosa the contact I worked with there is incredible detail oriented and amazing to work with. I can't say enough!! Austin Haggard Lawhorn",pos
"The absolute worst motel I've encountered. We asked to cancel upon arriving and were still charged the full amount, even though we cancelled and did not stay there. Very rude service, bad odor, disgustingly dirty carpets. Do your self a favor and avoid this place at all costs. My family chose the risk of not finding another place and possibly sleeping in the car and being charged than staying in this filthy dump!",neg

The toilet barely flushed. The sink leaked behind the faucet. The skirting on the beds were all messed up. The cleaning staff were more friendly then the Hotel staff.,neg
"It was a great place if your going to stay for a few days. We were only there one night for a night relaxation anniversary getaway and checkout was at 10am I don't know of any place that has checkout that early. When we called to ask if they had a late checkout we were told only 10 of the rooms are allowed that option and it's first come first serve and that we were wayyyy past that. The hotel is super family friendly so be prepared for kids, lots of them everywhere. Which was awesome if we had our kids but for the type of getaway we were looking for it was a little distraction. All together the rooms are huge and have everything you could need. With that being said we won't stay here again due to the early checkout.",pos
The service was great. The room size was small based on what we are used to.,pos
"It was a nice stay, the room seemed very clean but the chairs and the bed were not very comfortable.",pos
"The room, although fairly comfortable had the sink outside the bath. This created a problem when others were sleeping and someone needed to wash their hands. The breakfast in the restaurant was better than most places we have stayed, even though it was not as good as it could have been. Overall I would only rate this hotel as fair.",avg
"Clean rooms, but the lobby and stairs needed vacuuming, Ask for a room in the front hallway, rooms in back were noisy at night, perhaps construction noise. Nice breakfast. Nice pool. Perhaps a little pricier than I was looking for",avg

I also loved that it had access to the pool right from your room if we were staying there in the summer. The room had amneties that were great. The room had a Fridge, Microwave, etc. The breakfast was adequate and fresh.The night time staff at the front desk were rude if you called for information or asked for something.",avg
The hotel had a great free breakfast. The location could not have been better. Five minute walk to the train and bus line. Great shopping close by. The staff was wonderful. We had a two storied suite which worked well for my family. The only negative is there is a street that runs along the side of the hotel that was loud. People walking all times of the night.,pos

Location just 4 blocks from Bourbon St and 3 blocks from Hop on Hop off double decker bus which was a great bargain 39 good for 3 days. Only minus was the street is all torn up as they are putting in rails for a new street car line. Also the rooms could use a little spiffing up.",pos
"Americas Best Value Inn has poor service. They screwed me over twice with their Indian Manager. The first time they took my food and put me through a hard time getting it back. The manager Anil P. Motwani was hard to find, I didn't get in contact with him once. When I finally got my food back they kept my chicken. The second time I got screwed over, I check into the hotel around 2 a.m. Saturday morning, the lady at the front desk was not there I had to stand there and wait by that time I got tired and went to see if she was in the bar (The Edge) and there she was. She checked me in and I ask her what time did I have to check out she said Sunday Morning at 11 a.m. so Saturday around 2 p.m. they came and told me I had to check out the room and the manager also stated then We never let people stay over 24 hours. Notice it has only been twelve hours but no worrys because I will discuss this issue with my lawyer.",neg
Inexpensive but clean place with friendly staff. Only 1/2 hour from Georgia Dome late at nite so this location makes for a good nites pitstop if heading west out of Atlanta or looking to lay up a day before going into the city. Great price with discounts :),pos
We were there to see kids had 90+ grandpa with us they were able to give us side by side rooms with handicap bath great plus great stay we were aware of remodel going on it did not bother us staff was as good as it gets,pos

I stayed 6 days. It was the perfect location for me. The indoor pool was warm enough. The Jacuzzi was roomy. The exercise room was adequate.,pos
Room 202 was horrible facing the blvd because you can hear every vehicle pass by and it does not allow you to get a good night sleep,neg
Bed made noise and the housekeeper don't knock before entering the room.,neg
Nice room and staff was very courteous. Would stay again.,pos

Around 9:00 I decided to get the kids ready for bed and, based in the condition and cleanliness of the hotel, I decided to look under the sheets on the beds. Between the mattress pad and the fitted sheet, there were bed bugs crawling around...I didn't lift the mattress pad at that point. I called the front desk and told them there was a big problem in our room and when I mentioned the bed bugs, the front desk attendant did not seem surprised and said she would send the manager up to our room. The manager, too, did not seem surprised and said we could change rooms or get a refund. We left the hotel at 9:15 and went to another hotel in Iowa City.",neg
"Had a comfortable stay - room was good size, clean and comfortable. Nice pool area - we lucked out & used it when all the Little Leaguers were gone! We received complimentary breakfast coupons and the breakfast was good - had a choice between menu items or the buffet.

"Though not as commercial as other sectors of Paris, the neighborhood was very pleasing with lots of nice little places to eat and have a coffee. The staff at the hotel was extremely nice and friendly, from the front desk to the cleaning ladies. The Metro was literally around the corner, so mobility was a breeze.",pos
"We called ahead to request an early check-in as we had somewhere we had to be that afternoon. I was told our room would be ready at 2 pm, just an hour earlier than normal check-in. We arrived and were told our room was not ready. Not only was it not ready, but the guest before us had been smoking in a non-smoking room during his extended stay. We waited 30 minutes for another room to be cleaned to find out it also smelled horrible. The smell of smoke was so strong we kept the window open for the two days we were there. The front desk did not seem to be phased by this inconvenience regarding the smoke. We will never stay at that hotel again.",neg

NO ice bucket, they gave me a white garage bag for my ice. Beds sunk in a lot. Over all, if you can't get a room at a very nice hotel, go here, otherwise skip it.",avg
It smelled like urine in our room. The smell was so strong we needed to get air freshener to be able to sleep in it. The bed was also very uncomfortable.,neg

I was in Bangor for a concert at the waterfront. The hotel is about a 7 taxi ride to the concert venue so it's relatively close. The hotel itself is in a somewhat industrial area. The room I had was on the first floor and out the window was the back of a half run down industrial type building. The room was clean but had a bit of a musty smell. The air conditioning worked really well and the room had a bar fridge in it. The bathroom looked like it was recently renovated. The sink is not in the bathroom but in the actual room which is a bit odd and reminds me of the 1970's. Overall for the price it was good. I'd consider staying there again.,avg

El buffet est bien pero un poco repetitivo despus de dos o tres das. Lo peor son los horarios que estn muy adaptados al turismo extranjero pero tampoco es un problema. La piscina la cierran a las 18:00 horas y recogen las hamacas aunque te puedes quedar ms tiempo. Los horarios de animacin tambin estn pensados para extranjeros. Si llegas ms tarde de las 21:30 olvdate de ver el espectculo de turno. No te dejan sacar platos del restaurante de la piscina para que te los lleves a las hamacas. Y el todo incluido termina a las 23:00 horas. La playa est muy cerquita aunque es artificial pero est bastante bien, sobre todo para los nios. Por lo dems, la estancia ha sido muy agradable.

"I really do not like to give a bad review, but in this case I feel it is warranted, unfortunately. Firstly, the positive, the location is good (although you will hear music late late into the night from nearby bars and street musicians). Their description does not say that they are actually several buildings, so do not be mislead into thinking that you will be staying in the historic pictured hotel. only a few rooms are there. We were off to the rear of the main hotel in a boxed room with NO windows and clearly just a thrown together little square mobile home type structure. The plumbing was very poor, the shower did not drain so you stood in several inches of muggy dirty shower water while showering, the toilet took several attempts to get it to flush . When we first arrived to our room the pillows had no pillow cases. Then next day, the staff didn't even clean our room we came back in the early evening with the bed not changed or made up and all our dirty towels still in the shower where we left them. Its so hot and humid there that we had wanted to return to your room and take a showerbut not poss. I asked to have it cleaned and they said that someone had quit that day so they were understaffed. Not acceptable to me. The next day, after our room was cleaned, we noted they left only one hand towel for us to share. The floor had not been cleaned, there is just wood floor and walking on it bare foot all the little pieces of rocks/dirt from outside were visible and painful.",neg

This hotel looks nothing like the pictures the rooms are very small the heat didn't work the shower was falling apart the carpets smelted really bad.

Wir hatten ein Superior Zimmer im Haupttrakt. Das Bad wurde neu gemacht der Rest ist alt und nicht schn. Wie ein Spitalzimmer in weiss mit uralt Minibar. Wohlfhlfaktor null. Am Pool ist es schn wenn da nicht gerade eine Schulung einer Firma draussen stattfindet das geht gar nicht ein riesen Lrm.

Really tight self parking - and expect to pay 30 for it, with in/out privileges - but ultimately worth it because finding parking is a nightmare in this area. Good breakfast - scrambled eggs, sausage, bagels, cereal, granola yogurt. Check out at noon is a plus. Safe and quiet area, close to everything.

Rude and angry staff could not figure out how to use the computer.  He kept looking through stacks of papers and yelling at customers because we did not have printouts from Expedia to prove we had a reservation.  I called help desk and then the clerk yelled at him for 5 minutes.  Then Expedia explained that they could not help me get a new hotel room until the clerk agreed to refund Expedia.  So no room and no money - but Expedia did offer my a $50 credit.  So I was stranded in San Antonio at 1 in the morning with a credit - soooooo helpful.  I asked to talk to a supervisor - was told that there was a 45 minute wait.  Hummm I guess the long wait is because none of your customers are happy.,neg

The bed was AWFUL. Way too soft. I am dealing with a pelvis injury but it is very rare that I cannot sleep on a hotel bed (I travel for work and this was also a business trip).

The hotel is great- super nice staff, fun decor, comfortable rooms and bathrooms, only tiny negative is that their workout room is really small and limited, however, they DO have an indoor pool and there is a great running path along the river at the end of King Street. No in room coffee but complimentary coffee served in the lobby in the morning and wine in the afternoon.",pos

"I booked this hotel for one night on April 23rd. I got to the hotel about 11:30p and went to check in. The lady at the front desk couldn't find my reservation so I pulled it up on my phone and showed the email confirmation from Expedia. The young man at the desk found the confirmation and said it was for the 29th, I told them no it wasn't and, again, showed the reservation email. The young man told me it was 55.88, but my email told me 54.88. I said I would just pay the extra dollar. The lady asked me how many people, I told her 3. She then told me it wasn't going to be the quoted price of 54.88/ 55.88 but 69. I told her she might want to let Expedia know that the prices on Expedia's site is incorrect. I left and called Expedia, the representative from Economy Inn would not let the reservation be cancelled and they charged me for the night anyway!!! This place is a scam!! RUN AWAY AS FAR AS YOU CAN!!",neg

The hotel is across a highway (not the turnpike) from a truck stop. The truck stop had a subway and a restaurant to choose from for a meal. We ate at the restaurant and had good food and big servings. The Super 8 was a good place to stay right off the turnpike (easy off and easy on).,pos

Woke up with aching back, neck, knees and shoulders due to lumpy, bumpy sagging bed. Shower had very little water pressure.

"My husband and I go to the Cape every winter for 2 or 3 nights just to get away. We spend our days at the pool swimming, reading and just relaxing. I booked Bayside because we stayed here 12 years ago and had a large room with a whirlpool bath and I remembered the pool area was very nice. (We usually stay at another hotel but it suddenly closed for the winter.) I booked a deluxe king thinking it would be a decent size but it was very small except for the large bathroom which was very nice. The room was very run down in need of overhaul. The pool area was very nice but they had only 2 loungers which we were lucky to get during our stay. Construction woke us up the first morning and my husband planned on going to the gym which was closed due to the construction. We ended up having a good time but I doubt we'll return in the winter season. I'm sure it's nice in summer with the outdoor pool on the bay.",avg

I thought it was great to be close to the pool, ice machine and front desk the first two days/nights, but the last night was not very peaceful, unfortunately. The breakfast provided was good, a variety and we liked that it changed on the weekend, not the same every day. Could have used a little more space in the dining area, though.",avg

"Used as an overnight stay. Unless you know, the access to the hotel can be difficult. The hotel is decent clean, but basic. Room was decent and clean as was the en-suite bathroom. Unfortunately the restaurant was closed in the evening (This may be due to time of year (Early January and small number of overnight guests)). The nearest eatery was a greasy burger bar. I believe there may be better ones somewhere north of the hotel. Breakfast was fine. Staff were helpful and pleasant.",avg

"Hotel staff was cold. They answered our questions curtly and seemed to want us out of the office as quickly as possible. The beds were extremely uncomfortable and the decor is old...not charming, simply old and worn. On the Saturday night of our stay there was so much noise outside we could hardly sleep. Sunday night was quieter, but we still had a hard time sleeping because we couldn't get comfortable in the beds! The internet was spotty at best. The positives for this hotel are the garage parking which is included with your stay and the location. There are lots of restaurants just a block away, you can easily walk toward the water for a great view of the bridge, Fisherman's Wharf is walkable as is the zig-zag section of Lombard Street...if you are in good shape and enjoy mountain climbing. LOL! The walk isn't actually that hard and it's all part of the San Francisco experience. This hotel could be a gem with some customer service training for the staff, new beds and an updated decor. It could easily be changed into an adorable, comfy place to stay.",neg

The hotel itself is ok. The restaurant attached needs some help and it would be nice if the hotel offered free breakfast or at least a voucher at the restaurant. Shower/tube drain clogged with hair which seems to be a common problem at all hotels.,avg

Very old rooms with no updates for decades. As cheaply maintained as possible. The room was clean. The heater would NOT turn off - complained and was told it would be fixed. I doubt that anyone even looked at the heater. The phone kept flashing and the receiver button was stuck. The carpet was laid directly over a drain in the room. The king size bed had 2 small shams. The green wall paper was very old and very stained. I won't be staying at this hotel again. I had a hard time finding the motel. Google maps has it as an Econolodge and when I arrived I was told that it had been an Econolodge!,neg
I love staying at a Comfort Suites that is just as they advertise. They have wonderful beds. They are always soft and they give you 4 pillows to each bed. The breakfast is always great. They were checking on it at all times and making sure everyone was able to get what they want.,pos

"The hotel was beautiful, it had several pools and a lazy river to float in, the staff could not have been friendlier, Mario at the buffet, Erik the chef at Las Olas and Pablo the server at Las Olas Christian the pool concierge for the excellence club was the best, he knew what I wanted before I asked for it. We upgraded to the excellence club and it was totally worth it, from our own private hammock and bed to our outdoor bathtub, swimming pool and Jacuzzi from the room, fabulous, the food was nothing short of spectacular, I don't think I had one bad meal, and with ten restaurants the choice was outstanding. We were surprised the buffet was not open for dinner but it forced us to try all the great restaurants which you don't need reservations for. We had a couple of small issues which were attended to immediately, our room door was loose causing us to hear a lot of hallway noise and they changed it the same day. One night some rude guests were shouting outside of our room at 3am, one phone call and they were gone in five minutes. It was our anniversary and at no extra charge we received a champagne breakfast in the room and a special decorated table at the restaurant of our choice where we could order off menu if we wanted to. The morning of our anniversary Mario at the buffet brought us a piece if cake with Happy Anniversary written in chocolate on the plate and two candles. That really made us feel special. One of the best all inclusives I have ever stayed at.",pos

Expedia is the worst, I am so done with them.",neg

Notes about my stay: Hotel is undergoing renovations. Standard amenities provided by this chain, but it's all small scale. Room was spacious, everything in working and clean order. Walls were thin and I was woken by neighbors turning on water. Even though it was non-smoking, the room still had a stench of stale cigarettes.

If we had known that the room didn't have a bathroom (it wasn't shared, but we did have to leave the room to go to the bathroom, and be in the hallway that everyone on the floor uses, so it was not private-feeling at all), we wouldn't have booked it. I wish we would have known, because we would have chosen a different room. We would go back again, for sure, but stay in a different room. The grounds, house, breakfast, everything was incredibly lovely. An amazing place to stay and an easy walk to everything in Santa Barbara :)",pos

"The place is a dump. Open wires when you walk in the lobby. Very dirty. Peeling wall paper. Staff was rude. Would not allow anyone to check in prior to 3PM which is ok but a large group had assembled that were in town for the MN/IA football game. So as the line formed one person doing the check in had to count out her till, so she could not check anyone in at 3 which was poor timing. Then they both had attitudes about how busy it was, when they could have been checking people in at least as early as 2:30. So on top of it the cleaning guy has to vacuum the lobby and waiting area right at this time when the lobby is packed waiting to check in. The room was dirty. My bed look like it had been slept in. The TV remote had some sort of fluid on it. Wall paper peeling and mold and some other Unidentified crud on the ceiling. The toilet and sink themselves were clean which was amazing. Place looked like it may have been nice 15 years ago.",neg
"The value of the hotel was great for what you get. You get a nice buffet breakfast, and can pick up a newspaper to read. There were fresh baked cookies in the afternoon that you could smell in the lobby, but those went quickly. It was located right next to a Hilton Garden Inn which was listed for about 50 bucks more for the price I paid for this hotel. I know the Hilton is a nicer hotel, but unlesss you plan on spending all day in your hotel room, the Hilton is not worth 120+. The Quality Inn is great for a mid/nicer hotel. The price is reasonable (at least for the 75 rate I got), and with the amentities,. was worth it. The hotel smelled nice, except for the hallways which has a slight older smoke smell, but since you only spend a minute walking through them, was not bad, it did not affect the smell of the room. I was on the third floor away from the freeway and noise was not a problem.. Don't waste your money on a more expensive hotel that isn't really THAT much better, unless you like to spend money or have a psychological problem that if you spend 50 bucks more at Hilton, that you're getting your 50 bucks worth more, which you're not. Go to Quality Inn, it's better than you might think.",pos

"The hotel grounds are amazing, the views are spectacular, the food is great but the food service was a little bit lacking at times. We waited an hour for our food one night. Since the grounds are built on a hill, getting around is not easy and requires cart service to get around. Sometimes the wait was longer than expected for a cart to come by. We would have walked but the paths were not built for pedestrian use and could be dangerous. Food is very expensive, glad we opted for the all inclusive option. The high end restaurant LaFrida was well worth the extra 30 per person. If you don't mind wasting 3 hours, go on the time share presentation to get resort credit. We got 400 dollars which we used on two massages and the high end restaurant. Just keep in mind that they will tell you it is only 90 minutes long... which it wasn't. Don't feel bad about saying no to those salespeople. They are slimy like used car salesmen. Pay close attention to the bill when you check out, we had an issue with a very large extra charge that we found. It is unfortunate that they did not catch it first, and I didn't have to warn you. Do not do any of the buffets at La Nao, almost all the food is room temperature. There is food and drink service at the pools, but all the waiters moved at a much slower pace, and preferred to talk with each other than serve guests. Now besides the items I mentioned, it really was a nice place overall, and worth the money we paid. Probably will not return but onl",pos

We love this Hotel.,pos
"I did not book a 5 star hotel, so I went in with realistic expectations. Not everything was perfect in the room but it was clean, comfortable and well cared for. It had a balcony, kitchen and nice bed/bath. Despite having people above and next door to me, there was no noise problems at all. I stayed at this hotel during an intensive class while my peers stayed at other area hotels. They complained of because they had much less space, more noise problems and paid more. For these reasons, this is a hotel that was worth the money and I would stay here again.",pos
"Altough they only have three guest rooms,it is worth trying to book one.This is not a hotel.It is an 1895 home that the owners live in.It includes a fresh made breakfast every morning and wonderful pool area.It is close to Loda and downtown hot spots for dining and drinking.Or just stay in and relax.",pos

We had an awesome time. Beautiful resort. Great staff!,pos
"This is a lovely hotel that unfortunately smells horribly of smoke. We had a non smoking room, but the hallway outside smelled as if people had been smoking right there. We were able to get an extra towel to put up against the door which helped a little. Unfortunately, even the pillows smelled of smoke. Not good for an asthmatic. That being said the people were lovely, the rooms nicely furnished, and it was easy to get to from I-81.",avg

AC did not work but they moved me to a junior suite which was much nicer and bigger. Beach boardwalk was dirty and had lots of garbage on the sidewalk and boardwalk area,pos
We found cockroaches on the bed the morning after our stay. We are still trying the get the issue resolve with the hotel management. We even took a video of the cockroaches on the pillow and showed it to the manager. Overall we are not satisfied with this facility.,neg

The breakfast was also completely picked over at 7:30 AM. Overall a dirty... More",neg
Good for short business trip. Too close to the highway for romantic get away. Most of the employees do not smile. Nothing beats a sincere welcoming smile when checking in at a hotel after a log drive or a long fly. This should be the minimum of any basic training for any hotel employee.,avg
Housekeeping should read door tags if it says do not display. They still knocked on my door even though do not disturb sign was clearly present.,avg

got there very late and got told there was a 100 deposit despite already having paid for the room in advance. we were then told that the deposit would not be charged to our card but it was. then we were told it would drop off when we checked out in the morning it did not. we were already there on a tight budget and this just screwed up our entire trip. will not be staying there ever again despite the fact that the room was nice and clean but the air conditioner did not blow out cold air.,pos
Stayed in this hotel for four nights recently. Great location - close to everything and right on the boardwalk. No complaints.,pos
"For the price this hotel wasn't bad. My room had 2 queen beds and was actually pretty great. The neighborhood however, was terrible! I am not joking or exaggerating when I say I witnessed multiple drug deals. I was terrified to sleep alone with my infant child. I barricaded the hotel room door (because it's an outside hotel) and the door that adjoins the rooms. I would never stay here again just based on how scary the neighborhood/other guests were.",avg
Things were a bit loud at night. Lots of loud closing of doors and talking. We could hear interesting activity in the adjacent room. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. Nicest valet staff we've ever encountered.,avg
"I appreciated the receptionists' services they were really nice even at midnight when I checked in. Otherwise, there were some disadvantages such as terrible smell in the room we were stay the telephone didn't work at all the shower curtain was not waterproof so that water observed and flew down the floor the AC worked just fine there were not enough parking spaces for all guests. Anyway, the location is great. There are a lot restaurants nearby and it takes just about 5 mins to drive or walk to Disney Land.",neg

They ask you for 100 on a credit card or 200 cash. It for damages to the room. Like to grown responsible middle age men are going to damage the place really.

This trip was for a pleasant day at Oak Island It turn into a complete waste of time due to extreme traffic and construction in the area. The line was literally 10 mile back ups. Local traffic a mess Waiting in traffic to go to dinner for nearly 1-2 hrs.

"We drove just for a day to visit Hershey and stayed overnight. My last visit to Hershey left me with a bad taste in my mouth (I wrote a review about that hotel). From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with a hello and a smile. The whole check-in took probably at most, 5 mins (my tired children were thankful for this). We had a 2 double bed room that was updated, clean and had more than what we needed for an overnight stay. The bathroom was updated a clean as well. The linens were clean and the beds were comfy. We were pleased with the complimentary breakfast as well. It offered something for everyone, in my opinion. Fruit, muffins, cereal, danishes, eggs, sausage (turkey, too), biscuits with gravy, yogurt....etc. Upon leaving, I was once again sent away with a smile. I was asked about my stay and if there was anything they could do to improve my stay....honestly....no. **I'd like to add that my husband and I were a bit worried about our young children making noise. We were on the 3rd floor and it was pretty quiet. In the morning, waiting for the elevator...we noticed the guest leaving the room right next door to ours with 2 small dogs. If they barked...we didn't hear it at all.",pos
This is our fourth stay at the Dockers Inn and we were very satisfied with our stay. It is close to all the shopping but in a quieter setting than on the main street. Our room was clean and roomy.

"The hotel itself is fabulous and our room overlooking the San Marco canal and the Santa Maria Della Salute basilica was amazing. This section of the island is safe and in the middle of it all. The drawback is that the hotel does not offer very many amenities we found a small bar open but never managed to find the restaurant open for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. The hotel fronts the canal which is very impressive if you arrive by boat (which we did) but the entry sequence from the land side is a little creepy having to venture down small 4' wide allies to find the front door. Again the hotel is fabulous, however it lacks a little in amenities and the entry sequence is odd.",pos

"The first thing we noticed when we walked in was the strong odor of cigarette smoke. All of the signs indicated it was a non smoking room as requested but clearly someone had been smoking for quite some time in there. The hotel should have taken steps to remedy this before putting us in the room. I went to the desk seveal times to complain but no one was ever there. I was also puzzled at the lack of lotion and pen in the room. Seems minor but even in much more budget hotels, these things are always provided. Other than the odor, the hotel and room was clean and check-in/out was easy.",neg

We did not even stay. Saw the room and left immediately.",neg
The hotel stay was nice. We were there for the day. This was old Best Western hotel as evident from tray and toiletries. The outer look of the hotel is nice and so were the room interiors. Continental breakfast was nice. It was little pricey for the hotel but it may be high due to busy summer season and proximity to Yosemite national park near archrock gate entrance. TV remote was too complex to operate. Beds were ok.,pos
Great value close to Glacier Park. The rooms are cute and we had two queens in adjoining separate rooms which gave more privacy.,pos
"We had a fun time in Biloxi, the hotel was exactly as advertised, the room in the pictures looked EXACTLY like the room we stayed in. The pool area was a little odd to get to as it was on the roof of the parking garage, but the pool is very nice. They absolutely will NOT let you leave the pool area with a pool towel which means you should bring your own unless you want to travel from the parking garage, all the way across the hotel while wet. The Italian restaurant on site is decent and priced well. We had two rooms on the trip, the TV did not work in our second room for two days. The only channel on the TV showed adult programming at night, which meant since their were kids in the room TV was not an option. To be fair, we called the desk about this once, then complained again the evening of the second day and they fixed it right away after the second complain so most likely they simply forgot about it, but this does not reflect well on the staff. The lowest rating I give the hotel is the staff, other than that its a great stay. The main thing that bothered me was telling a 4 year old who stood there shivering that they couldn't take a towel to the room.",pos
"The back door to the parking lot was left unlocked at night so that anyone could walk in. Since my room was next to the door and the hotel is not in the best location, I didn't feel safe. Also, it doesn't have an elevator, so second floor access with bags was difficult.",neg

"Amazing Gatlinburg Cabin Rentals It was fun to view the famous Gatlinburg lights as we traveled up the mountainside to the beautifully appointed Elk Springs Resort! We continued to the very top in this community of colorfully tin-roofed cabins until we reached Almost Heaven! Truly breathtaking views! Everything inside was clean, modern and spacious. Amenities were most delightful and we enjoyed our company around the large dining room table and easily accessible kitchen/grill areas. Two large balconies provided that great Gatlinburg air, peppered with rocking chairs for maximum relaxation! As if we needed to leave this cabin, it is located very close to the downtown area, which is always great for a corn dog and people watching.",pos

There were outlets on the lamp on the desk on other side of the room, but had to utilize them for other (work) devices. Room was spacious, more spacious than other Holiday Inn's and was clean comfortable. Only had time for breakfast once (here working) and only had the scrambled eggs. Taste and consistency was fine.

The room didn't have a dresser to put clothes away and the bar in the closet was coming off the wall. The shower was pretty bad. The pressure was too hard and you couldn't adjust it. We could hear the pipes rattle through the walls, when our neighbors would use their sink. We stayed there for a week and actually thought about checking out early to stay somewhere else. I wouldn't recommend this place.",avg

Although it rained and we could not marry out on the lawn overlooking the beautiful rock formations, they have a gorgeous terrace that was still wonderful and romantic. There were deer on the lawn in the midst and the guests sipped hot chocolate in September. The food was delicious and the cake was the best anyone had ever tasted. The rooms were gorgeous and everyone was pleased and said we had the most beautiful wedding anyone had ever been to. I highly recommend Garden of the Gods Club!!!

Horrible. Very rude staff. Refused to comply with 100 guarantee. Room serve not done until very late and had to ask for room service still waited over an hour.,neg
"With the exception of waking up to a small flood of water on the sink and in front of the toilet in the bathroom, it was really nice. It seems something was wrong with the air through out the night. I was a bit warm.",pos
"There were no operating elevators, and staff failed to post directional signs to help guests find stairs, even after being asked to do so. As a result, I wandered the halls repeatedly looking for the stairs to second floor. Other than that, the stay was good.",avg
The people i encountered are helpful and polight and courteous. The Room was clean and neat. Bed was very comfortable. Handy in room coffee pot. Iron and ironing board. Flat screen tv. Nice exercise room and laundry facility. Close to down town. Hot tub too.,pos

"We were looking for a clean place to stay that was convenient for day trips to Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket and whale watching. The photos are very accurate. Our 13 year old son loved the pools and the game room which had ping pong and foosball. The staff was very nice and went out of their way to help us with our ferry tickets. If you are a high maintenance traveler, this is not the place for you but it met our needs perfectly. WiFi is a bit slow but we only used it to make travel plans. Lots of pretty neighborhood streets nearby to go jogging.",avg
Excellent. Next time I might check for handicapped accessible room to get a higher toilet. Otherwise it was perfect.,pos
"Mission Hills at Rancho Mirage is not terrific, but it is OK. The staff is fine. My sister is in an apartment unit, and it is average in size. The food is good, and the dining room is OK. I would recommend this facility to others.",pos
"The Hampton is a well-staffed and inviting hotel. Overall, I had a very pleasant stay. The double queen rooms have no refrigerator though, which is strange to me seeing how even the cheapest of motels have fridges in all of their rooms.

It was fine for the price. Breakfast wasn't much.,avg

I requested 2 beds when we got to the hotel at 11pm (after a long day working) no double beds were availble there were two of us adults. Holiday inn said its not their fault call Expedia ! When I did that Expedia said its holiday inns fault ! Fun night !!!!!!! Sleeping on the floor! I will be following up again on Monday ...,neg
We were pleased to find this hotel in the area we needed. Only stayed one night but it was very pleasant. Excellent breakfast in the morning.,pos
"We had a King room with a sofa sleeper. The room was nice and roomy. The bathroom was very nice. Walk in shower, nice tile. Towels and shampoo all set out very nicely. We had a fridge and a microwave. And we got two free breakfast coupons - which included their breakfast buffet, which was very nice, scrambled eggs, ham, potatoes, fruit, bakery, oatmeal, cereal, etc. They allow pets, which is very important to me! We really enjoyed our stay.",pos
"Last minute incident caused us to stay at this local hotel and since it was only going to be for one night and we are locals, I didn't want to pay an arm and a leg for a room. With that being said, the place was kind of eerie and the room was dirty. Floors were dirty, shower curtain was full of hair and mildew and room over all had a lingering smoke smell (room was non-smoking). We survived the night but I won't be going back to stay there and unfortunately, I can't say I would recommend this place either.",neg
"I booked this room while I was in town on business. I was pleasantly surprised to see the room was huge, with great decor. But most importantly an awesome lineup of DirecTV. The bathroom was also great as it featured a large shower. It was great.",pos

"When we arrived at the hotel and pulled-up to the Valet Parking, there was no one to great or help us. After almost 10 minutes we went in to the registration desk for help. We were able to get checked-in by the nice person, but the Hotel Manager was acting as the Bellman and Valet. We finally got help from him to our room but the process took about 25 minutes when there was no line or other customers present. Our room was very dirty complete with hair on the bed pillows, sick and bath tub. There was even a Calvin Kline pant sticker stuck on the bedroom door. We stayed two days and informed the staff of the issues, but the sticker was still there when we checked-out. There were food trays in the hallway all the time which smelled bad when the aromas mixed. I can only assume they retrieve the trays once a day. I can say that the staff was very friendly and helpful, but they seemed very harried all the time.",neg

This place is really conveniently located near Riva Road and the Aris T Allen exit to Rt 50. Our suite was quite (4th Floor) and the bed was comfortable. Our only complaint was that the room was too hot and we had to use the noisy A/C to sleep.,pos
Hotel was nice. Clean. Rooms were clean. Small dinning area in lobby. The reception personnel were nice and helpful. Nit far from airport. Free shuttle aervices to airport. Within walking distance in the main area in town. Recommend renting bicycle and riding bike around town.,pos
Everyone here was terrific from the desk staff to housekeeping to the ladies who had breaKfast ready for a large group of people both mornings - every time I've been at a holiday inn express I've had a great stay!

A great hotel. Excellent location. Lovely breakfast. Highly recommend.,pos
The staff was very friendly and efficient. An added touch was the fresh popcorn made each afternoon. It was a welcome surprise. Another feature that adds to my stay is the inclusion of breakfast and a fresh cup of coffee. My only complaint is that sound was easily heard between rooms. It seems many hotels have this problem. Other than that I have a very pleasant stay.,pos
It was great. The pool hours are just the perfect time for me. I really like the place over all. It was nice to have a nice comfy bed. The only problem would have to be a little older building so not as sound proof but great all together.,pos
breakfast was good. bus 2 takes you right to venice in 30 minutes.,avg
This place was excellent. Exactly what me and my friend needed after a long day of traveling. The guy by the name of Ankit who works there is an absolute legend.

"For the 70 plus a night it costs, this hotel is no bargain. Crummy, bare-bones continental breakfast no public computer, and horrible internet connectivity in the rooms not cleaned behind the night stand or dresser in a while, it seems no coffee packets left 2 days in a row in the room cheap, tiny soap, scratchy cheap towels- low budget all the way- except for the cost.",neg

From the lobby to the hallways to the room itself, it was the dirtiest hotel I've ever stayed in. The towels were a brownish gray. There was mold in the bathtub. There were stains on the sheets. I had to sleep in my sleeping bag. I could go on for a while, but hopefully you get the point. There are plenty of hotels in this area to pick from. Avoid this one.",neg

Don't stay here. Hotel staff is rude. Had to ask to have TV hooked up. Seedy neighborhood. Pool looked dirty. The door to our room had been recently repaired as it appeared someone had forced entry into the room at some point. A/C to our room barely worked and sounded like it was on its last legs. Staff would not or could not fix a/c. Stranger knocked on our door asking if we knew the previous occupants and wanted to repay them 'beer money'.,neg

"I never made it to the room. There were customers in the lobby complaining and being refunded. Signs in the lobby about cash transactions and age restrictions made the hotel seem a little dicey. Finally, there was a skunk at the front door and a rat at the back. The staff member said ""I can't believe we don't have the phone number for Animal Control with all of the wild dogs and cats out back"". Thankfully, I was told I would not be charged. I SLEPT IN MY VEHICLE IN A REST STOP. Felt safer in a rest stop on Interstate 87 than I did any where near that hotel.",neg

"From the moment I walked in I was greeted by name, offered complimentary beverages, assisted to my room, and had all my travel/entertainment questions answered before I was completely checked in. Although the design of the hotel not as retro and fun as their Helix Hotel counterpart in Washington DC, what they lacked in style they definetely made up for in service.",pos
"The hotel was easy off and on the highway, and reasonably priced, which were our main points for selection. The night clerk was very helpful for our issue. But that doesn't outweigh the huge negative of finding a condom wrapper between the sheets with suspicious spots on the blanket, which led us to believe they had not been changed from a prior guest. Upon my request, both were replaced and we were offered a different room, but inspection of this room included holes in both the sheets and blanket. Disgusting. If I hadn't booked on line I would have insisted on my money back. We would never recommend this hotel to anyone!",neg

"We made reservations because other friends from our group were planning on staying overnight. They planned on visiting a couple of local establishments the following day, so we stayed as well. The person behind the front desk was neither rude or gracious - - it was just a job. We got our room assignment quickly, and we went upstairs. Even at 4pm, we noticed there were still a large number of rooms still being cleaned. In addition, there were numerous large bags of trash sitting around the hallways. We settled into our room, and just started to unpack. My wife commented that the room did not seem particularly clean, and then noticed the toilet was stopped up. I went downstairs reported it to the front desk. The lady behind the counter moved us to another room, with a slight upgrade. We moved out bags settled in. This room definitely did not appear to have been cleaned completely, but we were very tired, and we wanted to settle in. The pool was very welcoming clean very relaxing. Breakfast the following morning was a disappointment. The eggs were not cooked the milk was warm the sausage was raw the bread was dry the pancake appliance was non-functional. Only the juice dispenser and the cinnamon rolls were acceptable. Overall, our stay was not bad. We got a good night's rest, and continued our trip the next day. Our visits to other comparable hotels has been must cleaner, friendlier, and tastier. It's not bad, but we won't be visiting again.",avg

"We would choose this hotel on any future NOLA trips. We had two rooms and they were really nice. The hotel was comfortable and convenient to everything. It sits just on the outside edge of the French Quarter so we could walk to everything, see the whole town, and then we could come back to the hotel and relax without being to disturbed. The hotel is kept up and clean with a great pool courtyard. It's not a new hotel so don't expect perfection BUT that is what makes it way better. You can stay in a chain hotel anytime anywhere, if you want an authentic NOLA experience this is the way to go! Would definitely recommend staying here.",pos
Stay was only okay. Only 1 mile to ABC studio so location was great. Room service was quick and delicious. Room was okay not very sound proof. We could hear the room next door TV until 3 am. Also floor had been rented out to a movie crew. It was difficult to get down the hallway to our room. It was extremely loud. There is a Starbucks across the street but no ther shopping. We were going to see a TV taping so location was great. Would not recommend this hotel unless you need this location. Also a 14 dollar a day parking fee,neg
"I recently stayed at the hotel while visiting some friends in Raleigh. The rooms were clean, staff was pleasant and helpful, and the price was great. The only thing I did not like was the hotel's location in relation to the local bars and restaurants. You definitely need to have access to a car, since you would not be able to walk and taxis are limited. I will definitely stay there again when I return to visit my friends.",pos
Great location at a great price. Need more pillows!!,pos
Great customer service,pos
"First and foremost, it's a beautiful hotel in a great area. Very comfortable room. But way to over priced for the stay. My only complaint is it so noisy!! Constantly people walking and talking loudly in the rooms and hallways. Up until 4:45am in the morning!! I could even hear the couple in the neighboring room have ""relations""! Very short and loud!! If quietness was a guarantee, I would consider staying again.",avg

"This has become our motel of choice in the Eau Claire area. We've stayed at 3 other establishments around town and have found this to be the best of the lot. The room is clean, quiet, spacious, and comfortable. The bed is perfect,,,, the best of all the EC motels. The staff is friendly and accommodating. My only complaint is that once the breakfast area closes there's no place to get a cup of coffee. But there are several fast food restaurants and gas stations within an easy walk and I get my precious coffee there. It seems out of the way from Eau Claire but the drive to the city center is all highway and actually quicker than many of the city street routes of the other motels. As I said, this is our motel of choice in the EC area",pos
Deca updated their rooms since the last time I stayed and they're lovely. The staff is always extremely friendly and they never let you pass by without a greeting.

"First thing I saw when I walked into my room was that the TV was plugged into an outlet on the other side of the room with an extension cord draped across the middle of the floor. Next, it seems as though the ""maintenance person"" had been trying to snake a clog from the toilet because they left the snake IN the toilet along with a brown sludge.I went and asked for another room. The hotel keys were reprogrammed incorrectly, so I went back AGAIN and had then reprogrammed. The next room looked as though the door had been busted down MULTIPLE times as the lock was barely hanging on to the wood and there were holes in the frame where it looks like it had been kicked down. There were a lot of strange people around who appeared to live there as well. I'm assuming the cockroach on the kitchen counter also lived there.The room had no trash receptacles whatsoever and the heater did not work which made for a rather cold sleep as it was between 40 and 50 degrees out that night. I had 2 nights booked and decided to check out early. I slept on a couch in the airport the next night waiting for my morning flight and was much more comfortable and felt much more safe than I did at this hotel.Absolutely would tell everyone to steer clear of this hotel at ALL costs.",neg

"When we first checked in the receptionist was very rude, not only to us but others that were walking in.  Then we get to the room and it seemed everything was okay, but on the 2nd day we were there, one of the legs broke on the bed around 4pm while I was taking a nap.  I went to the front desk to inform them about this and asked if they could have maintenance come over to fix it while we would be out till 10 or 11pm.  When we returned the bed was still broke.  I went to the front desk and asked if they would comp the price of the room for the night.  He proceeded to get upset with me and told me to check out and then he would refund the price.  This was all on a very busy weekend in San Antonio, due to high school graduations and there were no rooms available around the area.  Therefore we had to end up sleeping on the pull out sofa.  Very uncomfortable for someone who has had 6 back surgeries.  Stay away from this place, would not recommend it to my worst enemy.  Plus my parents had a room there also and had roaches in their room, DISGUSTING!!!",neg

The bed was comfortable, clean bathroom and the decoration was ok.great location I didnt like The water facet in the bathroom makes loud noise, also i did not like the smell of the capet when i first walked in. The carpet needs to be updated.",avg
OK.. The staged photos made it seem very upscale..not a place you would walk around at night. Clean and front desk was helpful,pos
"The hotel was not horrible for the price. The staff were very nice. My only complaint was that the beds were not very comfortable, but weren't horrible, and the rooms were freezing and the heaters did not work very well. We ended up having four rooms and had the same problem with all but one. The one we didn't have a problem with, got way to hot!!! But overall, I would probably stay here again if need be. We weren't in our rooms very much since we went to the city. Good place to stay when visiting someone from West Point.",avg
The room that I booked was very small for two people. The gentleman that registered me asked if I would like to upgrade to a larger room for the same price. I appreciated the gesture. We did find that there was an a smell to the room when we first checked in.,pos
Stayed here one night. Location is on the edge of town. Staff was friendly. Room was fine. Bed seemed a little old and not too comfortable. Would probably stay here again if passing through. All rates in Miles City for chain motels are fairly expensive.,pos
When we entered the initial room we were assigned all we could smell was either cigarette or cigar smoke in this NON-smoking hotel. We were assigned another room but it did call into question the overall cleanliness of the hotel in general that a room in a non-smoking hotel could stink of smoke.,avg
If you are going on a cruise this hotel is perfectly located and near some good places to eat the night before. We were given great directions to everything and we would gladly chose this property again.,pos
One night in and out. Decor had a sleek modern design. Entry into hotel somewhat odd. Didn't really shout enter here but very nice inside. I did get lost in one of the hallways trying to find my way back to the lobby from my room. Construction going on so seemed a bit messy in some areas outside.,pos
The breakfast was crazy You had a ticket to hand to the cook staff and then at that time they cooked your food. The line was crazy long . They need to improve on a better way to do this,avg

"I visited this hotel with my wife and 2 kids and we loved it! Food was great and the drinks were awesome! Very clean hotel and I would recommend visiting this hotel. Only thing is that you can walk around the resort easily due to steep hills, but there are plenty of golf carts w/drivers getting you around the entire resort which is HUGE fyi. My wife got sick 1 day but cant really say if was from the hotel food since we had gone into town to try the local food. Cannot go into the ocean at this resort but you can at their sister hotel Pueblo Bonito Rose, we went 1 day but the ocean is really rough and not good for little kids. My older daughter and I did swim in the ocean but it wasn't easy. I would visit this hotel again in the future. Please get a shuttle included in the package deal, they charge 80 each way to hotel/airport if you pay when you get to the airport.",pos
Great value,pos
"Beautiful, quiet location tucked in a neighborhood away from hectic downtown Catania. Surrounded by palm trees and beautiful grounds, a great escape. Rooms were very comfortable, beds/bedding luxurious and our room had two patios on which we could sit and enjoy the outdoors. Shower/bathrooms well equipped and plenty of hot water available. Breakfasts were normal European but plentiful. Only negative, there were no restaurants within walking distance but the front desk was willing and able to order pizza delivery (and it was terrific)! Would definitely stay there again.",pos
"We were not impressed at all!!. It was convenient, because it was next to the airport, but wasn't very clean. The continental breakfast room was very small, and wasn't impressed with the whole impression on the motel.. We had to book to another motel, and had a hard time getting a refund back, because we had booked 2 nights there, and stayed 1. The manager however did give us the refund back. I would not recommend this place to anyone unless it was just an overnighter!!!",neg

"Twelve is a great spot if you have the right waiter. My bestfriend and I went on a Sunday evening in which they were not busy and yet our waiter still ignored us. The pizza was greasy and my martini glass was cracked. We sat for about 20 min before we were even greeted or acknowledged. Gave no info on menu placement. We had to wait to place our order while our waiter bypassed us several times. The atomsphere is great, but he ruined it by the terrible service. Food came out and he did not refill drinks or even offer. After we finished, I had to get up and find someone to get our waiter because we sat about 20 more mins with dirty dishes in our face and no check. Where's my waiter Then a non-english speaking guy comes to pick up the plates. How did he get a job, somebody please call INS. Where's my waiter Finally a manger tells me that she is sorry and he was running room service b/c she was short staffed. Not my problem. Then the Waiter gets irate w/me and tell me to pay him and not the manager. He never apologized for his lack of customer service. Don't expect much of the service to be great here.",avg

"Checked in late on a Friday night. Around 6:45 in the morning heard gurgling sounds from the bathroom. I went to check it out and found sewage coming up through the shower and toilet that wouldn't flush. Soon it became apparent that this is happening through the entire hotel, not just our room. Plumber was called, but no shower, no bathroom and no breakfast due to breakfast are being flooded. We left for the day and when we returned at night we found that the sewage backup has been cleared but no one cleaned the bathroom or made the room afterward. So we ended up CLEANING THE SHOWER TUB OURSELVES in order to be ready for dinner in time. When we confronted the staff bout it, the guy behind the desk offered to send a cleaning crew, which we declined because it was too late. And then for some reason the lady behind him got an attitude and started telling us it's our fault that the room wasn't cleaned because *she* thought we already checked out. Why she thought that when all our stuff was still in the room that we prepaid for, she couldn't say. We went on to find out that TV and the iron did not work. The worst part of all this is that they refused to make ANY of this right, told us to take up our complaints with Hotels.com. Hotels.com couldn't care less, offered us some symbolic discount which I turned down. Thank God for Visa card - cancelled the payment on this charge for the entire stay.",neg

I was pleasantly surprised. We stayed the night, and not only was the staff (a mother and daughter) very friendly and accommodating, giving restaurant recommendations (try Blue Flame BBQ a few bu...view moreildings away...oh.my.god.), but the room was cleaner than my house (really clean), the second bed had its own locking bedroom, and there was a full kitchen, with a big fridge, pots and pans, plates, coffee and coffee maker, etc. It was 90, including tax, and I was very impressed.

The hotel is a while away from the main city, but we were able to figure out the public transportation with the help of the Radisson Blu's friendly staff. The rooms were clean and serviceable, and the bed was comfortable. It was just what we needed for our one day and one night in Istanbul during our long layover.",avg
"The hotel staff was very professional and friendly. How to get to the hotel was a little confusing but we eventually found it, you just have to go through the Staples parking lot to get to it.

The hotel was better than expected, super stylish decor and furnishings, cool vibe, complimentary breakfast. Location location location. The only thing i didn't like about the hotel is that they use double beds instead of queen for their double bed rooms, pretty small for two people. If I had stayed in a king bed room, I wouldn't have noticed at all. Travelling with kids though and we were cramped. To get nit-picky, the tub/shower was more three star than five star.

We picked this hotel because of the price and not entirely negative reviews. It pretty much lived up to its reviews. Not a great location, tucked between a wal mart and a lowes, with limited parking and a dimly lit parking lot. our room was fine and the bed was relatively comfortable. I didn't sleep well, but I blame myself for not bringing my own pillow. I can't sleep without a pillow, but I need it to be pretty flat, which hotel pillows are notoriously fluffy. My husband didn't sleep well because of the air conditioner. It was incredibly loud, which we both liked, because it drowned out the other noises in the hotel. Unfortunately, whenever the AC shut off, it was jarring and woke him up repeatedly. My only other complaints would be the room doors, which slam no matter how you shut them and the breakfast buffet, which is a healthy eaters worst nightmare (unless you can be sustained on mealy apples alone). To summarize, you get what you pay for. But this was by no means a terrible experience.",avg

"We found this property on Expedia and did not realize it is more like a gated community than a hotel. The resort is a little dated looking from the architecture but the rooms were nice and the beds were extremely comfortable. The only downside was that we reserved the smallest of rooms so there was not a mini fridge or microwave (we did not think we would need it at the time of booking). It was so late when we arrived that we did not have much time to look around but the restaurant at the clubhouse was open and had great live music. The food was also amazing! Not what we expected since most resorts are high price - low quality. There was so much food but since we did not have a mini fridge or microwave we could not take the leftovers. Since checkout was not until noon, it gave us plenty of time to explore the grounds and take a stroll on the nature walk. There are so many beautiful plants and the area is so peaceful. We will be sure to visit the resort again when we have more time so we can check out the pool and spa facilities.",pos

"When we got to the hotel our room was not available and they tried to give us a double twin bed room when we had payed for a king size. Then we had to wait a half hour for our room, even though when I called earlier in the day they said our room would be ready when we got there and we could come whenever since we had payed already. We also had ants in our room. Overall it was not a great stay,and I would like to request a free night stay or else I probably will not stay at your hotels anymore. I used to stay in them a good amount, and I am sorry to say that but that is how I feel.",avg

"Two of the three hotel staff I interacted with were not professional in their appearance; neither did they interact with me in a way that affirmed that I was a human being or a welcome customer. (One staff member was good though.) From what I could see, the room-cleaning staff does the best they can with what they have. The rate charged for the room was attractive but the savings comes at a different cost. This hotel really ""needs that special something.""",neg

We stayed for 4 nights in October in a junior suite. You are made to feel very welcome on arrival and that attention from staff continues throughout the stay (the mini-fridge and some lights in the room that weren't working on our arrival were looked at as soon as we mentioned them and then fixed the following morning). The staff are the hotel's strongest asset. The breakfasts on the roof terrace and the dinner in the restaurant were the best breakfasts and dinner respectively that we had on our 13 night 5 hotel stay in Sicily. Try the sea bass mimosa. The junior suite was smaller than anticipated with the bedroom only providing a little walk around space either side of the bed and the seating area where the settee was located being quite narrow so that sitting on the settee you were very much aware of looking straight at the wall opposite. The sitting area was only lit by spotlights and so was quite gloomy at night when natural light was absent and for some reason one of the spotlights was removed from the room on day 3 while we were out. We'd certainly have asked for this to be replaced if we had not been leaving the following morning. The bed was comfy. The outside space was quite generous with 2 loungers as well as a small table and chairs set. The hotel has a small pool and a reading room/lounge and decent wi-fi. The roof terrace has great views of Etna and the sea and is a good place for a pre-dinner cocktail or glass of wine.,pos
After a 15 hour drive with my 1 year old son I was ready to just sleep. We walk in the room and right when you walk in it smells like marijuana and cigarettes. I was instantly disgusted. There were burn marks on the sink and an ash tray in a non smoking room. I go down to the lobby and ask for lysol or something and I spray it in the room still doesn't help. I go back to take lysol and I tell them I'm not paying for this room. It smells horendous. They tell me they'really sorry and will give me 10 discount and at first that's all they could do and I told him the only reason I'm still staying here is because we drove 15-16 hours and we're all exhausted. So he gives us a queen room and a roll-away bed. I go to the bathroom and have to go to the bathroom with the door open because THE LIGHT WOULDN'T TURN ON! The food was alright. Pretty basic. Then when we checked out we didn't even get the 10 discount!!!! I'm appalled by this place and it shouldn't be called America's best it should be called American horror.,neg

I think the hotel was pretty good. I only needed somewhere to stay overnight and didn't even check in until 7pm and checked out at 5:30am. Beds were great! Just a calm hotel with indoor pool and jacuzzi. The only thing that I didn't like was the lack of refrigerator and microwave in the room.,pos

The AC was not working at night and we asked for somebody to come in the morning to have a look at it, however the staff forgot about it. It wasn't fixed in the end. The staff is not really helpful and you don't even feel like asking them about anything since they have this mannerism of giving you very general answers. In other words, they try to get rid of you in a polite way. The location is good though. 15 minute walk from the Ark. Nice neighbourhood.",avg

Hotel has a very strange odor.  Rooms are quite dated and need major cleaning.  The shower was full of mold/mildew and the bathroom outlet did not work.

This is a major safety risk and moreover not very good soundproofing... you may as well have slept on the highway outside the room.,neg
This hostel hotel seems really good for its value. Well refurbished. Warm. Spotless. Lots of self service facilities and communal spaces. Friendly and very helpful staff.

The gym had no air at all,a broken treadmill weights 20lbs over. Room was TINY. There was also the smell of marijuana on the 5th floor and partying in resulted in someone pulling the fire alarm at midnight and we had to be evacuated.

The people at the desk took forever to get there to help us, they barely spoke English, the bedrooms were dingy and HOT. The air hardly worked at all. If you opened your door it was cooler outside. The beds were rock hard. When you called to the office for help with something they didn't understand most of what you were saying and when they said something back it was in such a foreign tone that you couldn't understand them either. Not a good experience.",neg

"The motel room is small with a big space feel. This is because of lack of furniture.

It does have a table with a desk chair and a love seat and a shelf over the A/C unit to put suitcases. The rod for hanging clothes is very poorly placed in the approximate two feet between the bed and the wall, making it extremely awkward to get out of the bed on that side duck or hit your head. An iron and ironing board hang in the bathroom. The lavatory is in the bathroom and has little counter space.
